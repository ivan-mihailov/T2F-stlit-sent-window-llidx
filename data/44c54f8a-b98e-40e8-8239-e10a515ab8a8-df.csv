"WRITTEN OPINION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SEARCHING AUTHORITY International application No. PCT/EP2022/071991 Box No. I Basis of the opinion 1. With regard to the language, this opinion has been established on the basis of: the international application in the language in which it was filed. a translation of the international application into , which is the language of a translation furnished for the purposes of international search (Rules 12.3(a) and 23.1 (b)). 2.

"International application No. PCT/EP2022/071991 WRITTEN OPINION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SEARCHING AUTHORITY (SEPARATE SHEET) Re Item V Reasoned statement with regard to novelty, inventive step or industrial applicability; citations and explanations supporting such statement 1 Reference is made to the following documents: D1 WO 2004/080843 A2 (VINKS LINKS LTD [CA]; VINK MICHAEL A [CA]; VINK HENRIKUS [CA]) 23 September 2004 (2004-09-23) D2 EP 2 394 520 A1 (SHIMIZU KAZUHIKO [JP]) 14 December 2011 (2011-12-14) 2 The present application does not meet the criteria of Article 33(2) PCT, because the subject-matter of independent claim 1 is not new. D1 discloses a ""product"" (ie the device generally denoted 300 in fig. 5A) for storing and dispensing two or more consumable elements 24 for use with a non- combustible aerosol provision system (it is noted that conventional cigarettes as referred to in D1 indeed are suitable for use with HNB devices, as set out in the abstract and Figures 1+2 of D2), in which the product comprises two or more consumable elements 24 and a cigarette tape 316 (the tape forming a carrier), the consumable elements are supported on the carrier, the product is reversibly configurable (by means of locking mechanism associated with key 356; page 8, lines 24-28) between a packed configuration and one or more dispensing configurations, the packed configuration is one in which the consumable elements cannot be removed from the product, a dispensing configuration is a configuration in which a consumable element may be removed from the product. It follows that the subject-matter of independent claim 1 lacks novelty (Article 33(2) PCT). 3 Notwithstanding the observations under Item VIII viz. lack of clarity of the independent claims 40 and 41 the following is noted: 3.1 The present application does not meet the criteria of Article 33(2) PCT, because the subject-matter of independent claims 40 and 41 is not new. From D1, cf. the disclosure of page 6, lines 20-35 and Figs. 1-3AB, is a method known wherein a carrier 14 is provided and a consumable 24 is formed on the carrier. By means of the overlying element 102 which is laminated onto the element 14, the consumable is adhered to the carrier. Form PCT/ISA/237 (Separate Sheet) (Sheet 1) (EPO-April 2005)",9
"International application No. WRITTEN OPINION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SEARCHING AUTHORITY (SEPARATE SHEET) PCT/EP2022/071991 3.2 Concerning claim 43+44 it is noted that the kit thereof merely includes the not- novel product of claim 1 and an unspecified support. Providing a (reusable) support in the form of eg. a table for the product of claim 1 is considered to be within the disclosure of D1 (Article 33(2) PCT). 3.3 The methods set out in claims 45 and 46 concern the removal of a consumable 24 from the carrier 14/316 of D1 and attaching the cigarette to an unspecified support (e.g. a cigarette holder or a device as in D6) or concern the removal - presumable via the perforations 28 - of a consumable with its carrier and overlying element 102. These aspects are considered to be anticipated by D1, notably page 6, lines 30-33 (Article 33(2) PCT). 3.4 The use of a cigarette 24 (when removed from the device of D1) in a device according to D2 is considered to render the subject-matter of claim 47 obvious (Article 33(3) PCT). Similarly, the use the device including a resistive heater (1) of D2 with a cigarette removed from the carrier of D1 renders the subject-matter of claim 48 obvious (Article 33(3) PCT). 4 Dependent claims 2-19, 33, 34 and 42 do not contain any features which, in combination with the features of any claim to which they refer, meet the requirements of the PCT in respect of novelty and/or inventive step, see D1 (page 6, lines 20-35 in conjunction with Fig. 1 and 3AB) re. the features of claims 2-10 and 12-5 re. the material of the carrier and the coiled aspect thereof. The aspects of claims 16-18 regarding the provision of perforations for ease of separation of a portions of the carrier are addressed in D1, page 6, line 27 and in Fig. 1, 2 and 5A. The single cigarette 24 of D1 anticipates the subject- matter of claim 19 (""discrete portion of material""). The cigarette 24 of D1 can be removed from the carrier for subsequent use, hence the subject-matter of dependent claims 33, 34 and 42 is anticipated by D1 (Article 33(2)(3) PCT). 5 The combination of the features of dependent claims 20-32, 35-39 appear to be neither known from, nor rendered obvious by, the available prior art. In particular it is noted that the aspect of claims 20+21 (i.e. two discrete portions of different aerosol generating film) or the provision of a support which serves a susceptor as set out in combination in claims 22-32 neither is disclosed in nor rendered obvious by the prior art available. Likewise, the specifics of the adherence of the consumable to the carrier as set out in claims 35-39 are also not rendered obvious by the prior art insofar as the consumables therein are kept in position by laminating the consumable between two webs/carriers.

"International application No. PCT/EP2022/071991 WRITTEN OPINION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SEARCHING AUTHORITY (SEPARATE SHEET) Re Item VII Certain defects in the international application 6 Contrary to the requirements of Rule 5.1(a)(ii) PCT, the relevant background art disclosed in D1 is not mentioned in the description, nor is this document identified therein. 7 The features of the claims are not provided with reference signs placed in parentheses (Rule 6.2(b) PCT). Re Item VIII Certain observations on the international application 8 Independent method claims 40 and 41 refer to methods for making a product according to claim 1. However, the product of claim 1 is in particular specified by the aspect of a packed configuration and a dispensing configuration. These aspects are not present in claims 40 and 41, yet are considered to be essential in order for the invention to be carried out. Since independent claims 40 and 41 do not contain these features it does not meet the requirement following from Article 6 PCT taken in combination with Rule 6.3(b) PCT that any independent claim must contain all the technical features essential to the definition of the invention.

"Possible steps after receipt of the international search report (ISR) and written opinion of the International Searching Authority (WO/ISA) General information For all international applications, the competent International Searching Authority (ISA) will establish an international search report (ISR) accompanied by a written opinion of the International Searching Authority (WO/ISA). The WO/ISA may be responded to by · filing informal comments with the International Bureau of WIPO (IB) (where no demand for international preliminary examination (demand) is filed) · filing amendments under Art. 19 PCT (this can be done whether or not a demand is filed) · filing amendments under Art. 34 PCT and/or formal observations in response to objections raised in the WO/ISA (where a demand is actually filed) This document explains these possibilities. Filing informal comments After receipt of the ISR and WO/ISA, the applicant may file informal comments on the WO/ISA, directly with the IB (see International Search and Preliminary Examination Guidelines 2.15). These will be communicated to the designated/elected Offices, together with the International Preliminary Report on Patentability (IPRP) at 30 months from the priority date. Amending claims The applicant may file amended claims under Art. 19 PCT, directly with the under IB by the later of the following dates: Art. 19 PCT . 2 months from the date of mailing of the ISR and the WO/ISA · 16 months from the priority date However, any such amendment received by the IB after the expiration of the applicable time limit shall be considered to have been received on time by the IB, if it reaches it before the technical preparations for international publication have been completed (the 15th day prior to the date of publication, see PCT Applicant's Guide, International Phase, 9.013). For further information, please see Rule 46 PCT as well as form PCT/ISA/220. Please also note that, when filing amended claims under Art. 19 PCT, such amendments shall be accompanied by a letter identifying the amendments made and also the basis for the amendments in the application as originally filed (Rule 46.5(b) PCT). Where a demand is filed, failure to comply with this requirement may result in the amendments being ignored in the International Preliminary Examination Report (IPER), see Rule 70.2(c-bis) PCT.",13
"Filing a demand for international preliminary examination Filing a request international search The applicant may, with the IB, file a request for supplementary international for supplementary search under Rule 45bis.1 PCT. The present ISR and WO/ISA may also be taken into account in the execution of that supplementary international search, provided that these are available to the Authority charged with this task before it starts the supplementary search (Rule 45bis.5 PCT). In principle, the WO/ISA will be considered to be the written opinion of the International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA). Where the WO/ISA issued by the EPO as ISA gives a positive opinion on the international application and the invention to which it relates, filing a demand with the EPO as IPEA would normally be unnecessary, since a positive IPRP would anyway be established by the IB based on the WO/ISA (see also further below). : If the applicant wishes to file a demand (for example, to allow him to argue his case in international preliminary examination with regard to objections raised in a negative WO/ISA before the IPEA issues an IPER), this must be done before expiration of 3 months after the date of mailing of the ISR and WO/ISA or 22 months after priority date, whichever expires later (Rule 54bis PCT). Amendments under Art. 34 PCT can be filed with the IPEA, normally at the same time as filing the demand (Rule 66.1(b) PCT) or within the time limit set for reply to any written opinion issued during international preliminary examination by the IPEA. If a demand is filed at the EPO as IPEA and no comments/amendments have been received by the time the EPO starts drawing up the IPER (Rule 66.4bis PCT), the WO/ISA will be transformed by the IPEA into an IPER (also called the IPRP (Chapter II) which would merely reflect the content of the WO/ISA (OJ 10/2011, 532). The demand can still be withdrawn (Art. 37 PCT). Please also note that, when filing amendments under Art. 34 PCT, such amendments shall be accompanied by a letter which identifies the amendments made and also the basis for the amendments in the application as originally filed (Rule 66.8(a) PCT). Failure to comply with this requirement may result in the amendments being ignored in the IPER (IPRP (Chapter II)), see Rule 70.2(c-bis) PCT. End of the international phase This kind of request cannot be filed specifying the ISA who did the international search. More information on this topic can be found in the PCT Applicant's Guide, Chapter 8 (http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/guide/ip08.html). Where no demand is filed, at the end of the international phase, the IB will transform the WO/ISA into the IPRP (PCT Chapter I) (Rule 44bis PCT), which will then be transmitted together with possible informal comments to the designated Offices. Where a demand is filed, the WO/ISA is not transformed into an IPRP (Chapter I) by the IB, but rather the IPEA will establish an IPER, (the IPER is the same as the IPRP (PCT Chapter II), see Rule 70.15 PCT). 1",14

"Description EP 2 394 520 A1 TECHNICAL FIELD 5 [0001] The present invention relates to a tool for allowing smoker to inhale nicotine vaporized from tobacco leaves by directly heating the tobacco leaves without combusting the tobacco leaves. BACKGROUND ART 10 [0002] Tobaccos include chewing tobacco, snuffing tobacco, cigarette, cigar and so on, in which the cigarette and the cigar allow vaporization and inhalation of nicotine, tar and other components contained in tobacco leaves by lighting the tobacco leaves and combusting the tobacco leaves. The temperature of the burning portion reaches 600 to 900°C. Many fires are reported to be caused by smoking in bed, throwing burning cigarette, and so on. [0003] In recent years, many cigarettes are smoked because of the easiness of handling. However, when a cigarette 15 is lighted for smoking, it is known that the tobacco leaves are burned, and at the same time the wrapping paper containing many chemicals is burned, so that the tobacco smoke contains many harmful materials to human bodies, other than nicotine, as represented by tar, carbon monoxide, acetaldehyde, acrolein, benzopyrene, and so on. In recent years, many filter cigarettes are smoked in order to reduce adverse effects on human bodies due to the smoking. Various ideas have been incorporated into the filter to absorb the harmful materials to human bodies as represented by nicotine, tar, 20 carbon monoxide, acetaldehyde, acrolein, benzopyrene, and so on so as to prevent much of these harmful materials from entering human bodies of smokers who smoke the filter cigarettes. [0004] However, although the harm of tobacco to a smoker smoking a filter cigarette and thus inhaling smoke with a reduced level of these harmful materials is reduced, bad effects of so-called passive smoking have been pointed out that people around the smoker are forced to directly smoke the smoke (secondary smoke) rising from the burning portion, 25 and thus to directly inhale the smoke containing these harmful materials. As a result, in recent years, smoking is prohibited in companies, in tea rooms and restaurants, in public transportation including airplanes, trains, buses and taxis, in public places including roads, airports, stations, and so on, so that there are fewer and fewer places where smokers can smoke. Furthermore, smoking causes that a room or car where the smoking has taken place is filled with specific smell of tobacco smoking, and very unpleasant smell for non-smokers remains in the room or car. 30 [0005] In addition, when one wants to smoke during work, it is required to go to a specific smoking place for smoking. It is said that work stops during such time, essentially reducing work time, thus reducing work efficiency It is said that the reason why a smoker cannot quit smoking regardless of such bad effects is because the body of smoker is already nicotine-addicted, so that the amount of nicotine in the body decreases by not smoking for a certain period of time, causing withdrawal symptoms, and that the desire of the body to ease the withdrawal symptoms makes quitting smoking difficult. 35 [0006] Thus, non-combustion smoking devices to heat only tobacco leaves for inhalation of nicotine and so on contained in the tobacco leaves have been devised since pretty long time ago. [0007] Patent Document 1 discloses a non-combustion device as set forth below. The invented product has a small container formed in a mouthpiece portion, and is designed so that tobacco leaves can be filled in the container, and the container can be electrically heated to a temperature to vaporize necessary components. This is designed to allow vaporization of nicotine and so on from the tobacco leaves when heated hot air passes through in the tobacco leaves filled in the container. The components vaporized from the tobacco leaves and the ""hot air"" are introduced through the mouthpiece into the respiratory organ of a person using the device. 40 45 [0008] Patent Document 2 discloses a non-combustion smoking tool which allows tobacco leaves to be filled in a container and electrically produces ""hot air"", and which introduces the ""hot air"" into the container and allows it to pass through in the tobacco leaves filled in the container when a smoker inhales, whereby the ""hot air"" heats the tobacco leaves to vaporize nicotine and so on from the tobacco leaves, making it possible to inhale nicotine along with the ""hot air"". [0009] However, these non-combustion smoking tools cause inhalation of nicotine and so on along with ""hot air"", thus causing the mouth of the inhaler to be hot inside. In order to improve this problem, these tools are devised to take in outside air, and thus devised to prevent the smoker from feeling hot in the mouth by taking in ""cold outside air"" and ""hot air containing nicotine and so on"" at the same time. 50 [0010] Further, in Patent Document 3 and Patent Document 4, there are concepts of tools in which a rod shaped case having nicotine and flavor material impregnated therein instead of real tobacco leaves is prepared, and the case is heated to vaporize the nicotine and flavor material filled in the case, making it possible to take in these vapors. However, these vapors are not nicotine and so on from real tobacco leaves, so that they are very far from the flavor of real tobacco leaves. 55 [0011] Furthermore, in Patent Document 5, there is a concept of smoking tool in which a rod shaped chamber is prepared, and two kinds of metals are put in the rod shaped chamber, while tobacco leaves are wrapped around the 2",16
"EP 2 394 520 A1 rod shaped chamber for use. This tool is heated by an electric current flowing in the two metals. When the rod shaped chamber is heated, the tobacco leaves wrapped around the chamber are heated to allow nicotine and so on vaporized from the tobacco leaves to be inhaled. However, inhalation of a general commercial cigarette or cigar, as it is, is not possible with this tool. 5 PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS Patent Documents 10 [0012] Patent Document 1: US Patent 2, 104,266 Patent Document 2: US Patent 4, 141,369 Patent Document 3: Japanese Translation of PCT Application 2006-525798 Patent Document 4: Japanese Patent 3,012,253 Patent Document 5: US Patent 5,285,798 15 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 20 PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION [0013] The present invention is proposed in view of such conventional circumstances, and the object is to devise a tool which, while using a general commercial cigarette or cigar as it is, can vaporize nicotine from tobacco leaves at a suitable temperature to enable smoker to inhale the nicotine without combusting the tobacco leaves, making it possible to inhale it. 25 MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM 30 [0014] In orderto solve the above-described problems, a slender heater having a sharp end is inserted into a commercial cigarette or cigar to directly heat only tobacco leaves so as to vaporize nicotine from the tobacco leaves at a relatively low temperature and enable its inhalation. EFFECT OF THE INVENTION 35 [0015] While products of prior inventions cannot be used without filling tobacco leaves in a container or forming the tobacco leaves in a sheet shape, the present invention has an advantage to allow use of a commercial cigarette or cigar as it is, which is practically very convenient. [0016] Further, the prior inventions heat tobacco leaves by allowing ""hot air"" to pass through in the container filled with the tobacco leaves. However, the present invention has an advantage that by inserting a heater into a commercial cigarette or cigar and supplying heat from the heater directly to the tobacco leaves, it is possible to vaporize nicotine from the tobacco leaves at a relatively low temperature (70°℃ to 230℃) and supply nicotine from the real tobacco leaves to the smoker without producing harmful tar, carbon monoxide, benzopyrene, and so on that are produced at the time of lighting tobacco for smoking and are inhaled into the body. 40 45 [0017] Further, the present invention also has an advantage that since the heater inserted in the real cigarette or cigar directly heats the tobacco leaves, the heat utilization efficiency increases, making it possible to use a relatively small heater, and reducing the amount of electric power used, so that if a battery is used as a power supply, it can be a small battery, resulting in that the shape of the tool can be made small so as to increase the portability of the tool. [0018] Further, the present invention also has an advantage that since the heating portion is located near the center of the cigarette, the temperature of heating the wrapping paper containing many chemicals is lowered, thereby enabling reduction of the vaporization of harmful chemicals from the wrapping paper. 50 [0019] Further, the present invention also has an advantage that since the heating portion is located near the center of the cigarette, the heat transfer to the outer case is reduced, resulting in that the outside temperature of the tool is low, thereby preventing the smoker even holding the tool of the present invention by hand from feeling hot. [0020] Further, the present invention also has an advantage that even when a commercial cigarette or cigar is inserted 55 into the tool of the present invention, the shape of the cigarette or cigar does not change, so that it is possible to take a cigarette or cigar out of the tool midway during smoking of the cigarette or cigar using the tool, move to a smoking- permitted place, and light the cigarette or cigar taken out, so as to enable normal smoking by lighting. [0021] Further, according to the present invention, a commercial cigarette or cigar is used in the form as it is, so that 3",17
"EP 2 394 520 A1 a smoker can dispose of the cigarette or cigar every time it smokes. Thus, there is an advantage that even if the smoking tool was used by others, and if a person having used the tool in advance has germs, there is no concern of oral infection because what the mouth of the smoker touches are only the cigarettes or cigars which the smoker has. [0022] Further, the present invention also has an advantage that there is nothing to be disposed of after inhalation of 5 nicotine, other than commercial cigarettes or cigars from which nicotine has been removed and which are to be disposed of. Thus, these materials can be easily burned up, which is environment-friendly as well. [0023] Further, the present invention also has an advantage that because of non-use of fire, there is no danger of causing fire due to smoking, so that it is possible to take in nicotine from tobacco leaves even in places where open flame is prohibited, such as where gasoline is handled. 10 [0024] Further, a combination of the product of the present invention and a portable game machine makes it possible to inhale nicotine of tobacco leaves in public transportation such as airplanes, trains, buses, taxis and so on where no smoking is required, so that even heavy smokers do not feel pain during long hour journeys and can enjoy comfortable journeys. 15 [0025] Further, at work in general companies, if the product of the present invention is combined with, for example, a machine tool, a soldering iron or an office equipment such as a telephone set, or is placed on a table in e.g. an office room or a conference room, it is possible to inhale nicotine from tobacco leaves even during work, during business or during conference, so that there is no need to leave the place of duty for ""smoking"" during work, during business or during conference, thus significantly increasing work efficiency. 20 [0026] Further, in general homes, smokers cannot smoke in the room, which leads to smoking on a cold balcony (who are called ""firefly tribe"" in Japan). However, the use of the product of the present invention makes it possible to smoke in the room because there is no smell attached to the room.

MODES FOR CARRAYING OUT THE INVENTION 40 [0028] Hereinafter, detailed description will be made with reference to the drawings, giving a filter cigarette as an example of commercial cigarettes and cigars for the present invention. EXAMPLE 1 45 [0029] FIG 1 shows appearance of an example of a tool according to the present invention. A tool 100 comprises: a tobacco insertion opening 9 for inserting a filter cigarette 90; a projection 10; an indicator 5 for indicating an operation state; a connector 6 (shown in FIG. 2) for receiving electric power from outside; an outside air inlet 8; and inner constituents shown in FIG. 2. 50 FIG. 2 is a view for explaining the inner structure along section line A-A' of FIG 1. The tool of the present invention basically comprises: a slender heater 1 with a heater sleeve 7; a thermal insulation pipe 2 for preventing heat of the heater 1 from being transferred to an outer case 3; the outer case 3 with the outside air inlet 8; a stopper 4 for fixing 55 an insertion stop position of the filter cigarette; the indicator 5 for indicating the operation state of the tool; and the connector 6 for receiving electric power from outside. The heater sleeve 7 includes a sealing portion 28 for securing long-term reliability of the heater 1. A printed circuit board 13 has mounted thereon at least the connector 6, the indicator 5, the heater 1, a control circuit A11 of the indicator 5, and a control circuit B of the heater 1. Here, an end 4",18
"EP 2 394 520 A1 of the heater 1 is designed to be positioned slightly inside the tobacco insertion opening 9, which is considered in order to prevent a smoker using the tool of the present application from getting burned. FIG 3 is a view for explaining the inner structure along section line B-B' of FIG 1. The outer case 3 is formed and shaped to hold the thermal insulation pipe 2, the heater sleeve 7 and the printed circuit board 13, which are placed internally. 5 [0030] Regarding how to use the tool 100 according to the present invention, it is used in a procedure described below. 10 1. A smoker inserts its favorite filter cigarette 90 into the cigarette insertion opening 9 of the tool 100 up to where it is stopped by the stopper 4. This allows the slender heater 1 to be inserted into a tobacco portion 92 of the filter cigarette 90. FIG. 4 shows a positional relationship between the tool of the present application in this state of insertion and the inserted filter cigarette 90. 2. The smoker waits until electric power is supplied through the connector 6 of the tool of the present application to raise the temperature of the heater 1 so as to directly heat the leaves of the tobacco portion 92 and vaporize nicotine. Here, the indicator 5 may inform that it has become possible to inhale, or may simply indicate only the heating state. 3. When the tobacco leaves are heated, and vaporization of nicotine from the tobacco leaves starts, the smoker inhales nicotine vaporized from the tobacco leaves through a filter 91, either while the filter cigarette 90 is kept inserted in the tool of the present application, or after the filter cigarette 90 is taken out of the tool of the present application. 15 20 4. Thereafter, steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the vaporization of nicotine from the tobacco leaves of the filter cigarette 90 stops. [0031] Another procedure to use the tool 100 of the present application is described below. 25 1. A smoker sets the stopper 4 at a front position in advance. For example, it is set at a position to allow insertion of about 1/3 of a tobacco portion 92. The smoker supplies electric power to the tool of the present application through the connector 6 to heat the heater. 2. The smoker inserts its favorite filter cigarette 90 into the cigarette insertion opening 9 of the tool 100 up to where it is stopped by the stopper 4. This allows the slender heater 1 to be inserted into about 1/3 of the tobacco portion 92. 30 4. When the smoker inhales and feels that the vaporization of nicotine from the tobacco leaves has stopped, the smoker moves the stopper to a further rear 1/3 position and sets it at such position either by using the filter cigarette or by using a stopper position change button 44. This allows tobacco leaves of a new portion of the inserted filter 35 cigarette 90 to be heated, resulting in that nicotine is newly vaporized from the tobacco leaves of such portion. 5. Further, when the smoker inhales and feels that the vaporization of nicotine from the tobacco leaves has stopped, the smoker sets the stopper at a further rear 1/3 position so as to allow tobacco leaves of a new portion to be heated, so that nicotine is newly vaporized from the tobacco leaves of such portion. 3. When the tobacco leaves are heated, and vaporization of nicotine from the tobacco leaves starts, the smoker inhales nicotine vaporized from the tobacco leaves through a filter 91. 6. This way of inhalation allows the smoker to inhale nicotine for a long time even with a single filter cigarette 90. 40 EXAMPLE 2 [0032] Hereinafter, a slender heater 1 having a sharp end to be used for the present invention will be described in detail. [0033] Approximate dimensions of a general filter cigarette 90 are tobacco portion L2=58mm, filter portion L1=26mm, and diameter=8mmQ. 45 [0034] Insertion of a slender heater into the filter cigarette 90 is not easy. First of all, it is required to have a sharp end as a condition. 50 [0035] FIG. 5 shows a cross-sectional view of an inner structure of a general slender heater 1. A metal tube 22 is sealed with an end sealing portion 21 to prevent moisture from entering inside. The metal tube 22 has inside a resistance heating wire 24 (which portion is heated to serve as a heater) and an inner lead wire 25 connected to the resistance heating wire 24 by welding, and contains magnesium oxide powder 23 filled inside. The inner lead wire 25 which extends from the heater sleeve 7 is in turn connected on the outside to a lead wire 8 made of a solderable wire. While the end sealing portion 21 is welded to the metal tube 22 by metal, the sealing portion 28 is sealed by glass, so that when the heater 1 is used, it is required to be used at a temperature of the sealing portion 28 not higher than 150°C. If it is used at 150°C or higher, it causes cracks in the glass sealing portion 28, and moisture enters inside to react with MgO, reducing insulation of MgO. 55 [0036] The sealing portion 21 of the heater 1 is substantially flat in structure, so that it cannot be easily inserted into the filter cigarette 90 as it is. Thus, the present inventor welded an end 30 made of metal to the end sealing portion 21 5",19
"EP 2 394 520 A1 as shown in FIG. 6 so as to sharpen the end of the heater. Although this makes it possible to easily insert the heater 1 into the filter cigarette 90, a problem still remains that if the diameter of the heater 1 increases, it cannot be inserted. [0037] Thus, the present inventor made experiments to find heater diameters to enable easy insertion into the filter cigarette 90. 5 [0038] The results as shown in Table 1 are the experimental results obtained. [Table 1] 10 15 1 Q=1.0 Smooth insertion is possible. 2 Q=1.5 Smooth insertion is possible. 3 Q=1.7 Smooth insertion is possible. 4 Q=1.9 Smooth insertion is possible. 5 Q=2.1 Insertion is possible although with a little resistance. 6 Q=2.3 Insertion is possible although with resistance. 7 Q=2.5 Insertion resistance is high. Deformed outline is observed. 8 Q=2.7 Insertion is difficult. Forced insertion sometimes tears the paper. 20 [0039] From the above experimental results, it has been found that the diameter of the heater 1 is required to be Q=2.3mm or smaller to enable a smoker to smoothly insert a filter cigarette 90 into the tool of the present application. EXAMPLE 3 25 [0040] Next, tobacco leaves of a real filter cigarette were taken out, and the components vaporized from the tobacco leaves were analyzed, using a gas chromatography mass spectrometer, by putting only the tobacco leaves in a vessel and heating the vessel. Here, a focus was placed on the amount of nicotine produced among the components vaporized from the tobacco leaves, and its data were obtained. Table 2 shows the results. The heating time was 5 minutes. 30 [Table 2] 35 40 1 Heating temperature=70℃ 1000ug 2 Heating temperature=150℃ 3600ug 3 Heating temperature=200°℃ 4300ug 4 Heating temperature=230℃ 4300g 5 Heating temperature=250℃ 3060ug Leaves get combusted. 6 Heating temperature=280℃ 1027ug Leaves get combusted [0041] An encyclopedia says that nicotine is oily liquid with a boiling point (decomposition) of 247℃. The reduction in the analyzed data amount when the heating temperature reaches 250℃ is presumably because decomposition of nicotine vaporized out of the tobacco leaves by heating has started. 45 [0042] By further observing the appearance of the tobacco leaves, it has been found that the temperature is required to be 230°C or lower. EXAMPLE 4 50 [0043] On the other hand, since a smoker may use the tool of the present application by holding it by hand, it is required to be devised to prevent the outer case 3 from getting hot with the heat of the heater 1 transferred to the outer case 3. [0044] Further, in order to make the finished outer case 3 compact, the heater 1 is required to be bent into U-shape for use as shown in FIG. 5. However, this structure causes a new problem that the heater 1 gets close to the heater sleeve 7 so as to raise the temperature of the sealing portion 28 in the sleeve 7 by the heat of the heater 1, making it impossible to secure long-term reliability of the heater 1. 55 [0045] In order to solve this problem, the present inventor has provided a thermal insulation pipe 2 (an example being a glass pipe or a ceramic pipe) for the heater 1. The use of the thermal insulation pipe 2 has made it possible to obtain 6",20
"EP 2 394 520 A1 the following advantages: . It is difficult for the heat of the heater 1 to be transferred to the outer case 3, enabling the smoker to hold the tool of the present application for inhalation. 5 . It is difficult for the heat of the heater to be transferred to the sealing portion 28, making it possible to secure reliability of the heater. · When inserting a filter cigarette 90 into the tool of the present application, the thermal insulation pipe 2 serves as a guide for insertion. . Further, when the filter cigarette 90 is inserted into the tool of the present application, the heater 1 pushes out the inserted tobacco leaves, allowing the filter cigarette 90 to be larger in outer diameter and difficult to be drawn out of the tool of the present application. 10 15 [0046] In order to achieve these advantages, it has been found as a result of experiments that the optimum inner diameter of the thermal insulation pipe 2 is the outer diameter of the filter cigarette 90 plus 0.01 to 2.0mm. EXAMPLE 5 20 [0047] Next, a stopper 4 to be used for the tool of the present application will be described. FIG. 7 shows an embodiment example of the stopper 4. The stopper 4 is disc shaped and has outer claws 41 having spring properties as well as inner claws 42 having spring properties, to respectively generate frictional forces between the springs and the thermal insulation pipe 2 as well as the heater 1, so as to be fixed at an arbitrary position. According to the tool of the present application, the stopper 4 can be stopped at a predetermined position as a fixing position e.g. by inserting a slender rod through the tobacco insertion opening 9. 25 EXAMPLE 6 [0048] FIGs. 8 show a structure of a stopper 4 according to another example. In order to use the stopper of the present example, a groove 45 is formed in a side of an outer case 3 of a tool 100, while a space is formed between the outer case 3 and a thermal insulation pipe 2. A stopper 43 shown in FIG. 8-2 and FIG. 8-3 is inserted into this space. It is not necessary to explain that the positioning of the stopper is performed by a stopper positioning knob 44. 30 EXAMPLE 7 35 [0049] FIG. 9 shows Example 7. Nicotine was inhaled using a tool of the present application, and actually using a filterless cigarette and a cigar. In order to prevent a smoker using the tool of the present application from getting burned, the end 30 of the heater 1 does not project outside the tobacco insertion opening 9, causing a problem that all the tobacco leaves cannot be heated when the tool of the present application is used for a filterless cigarette or a cigar. More specifically, the problem is that about half of the tobacco leaves cannot be heated when the filterless cigarette or the cigar is used in the tool of the present application, because the tobacco leaves outside the tobacco insertion opening 9 cannot be heated. 40 [0050] Thus, the present inventor has devised a mouthpiece 110 which can be attached to the tool of the present application. The present mouthpiece 110, while having a shape similar to a mouthpiece portion of a normal smoking pipe, has an end portion 80 having an inner structure to fit to the projection 10 of the tool 100 of the present application. This structure can be any structure invented so far for a fitting method. The attachment of such mouthpiece 110 to the 45 tool of the present application makes it possible to insert the entire length of the filterless cigarette or the cigar into the tool of the present application, making it possible to heat all the tobacco leaves. Further, the intake rate of the amount of nicotine vaporized from the tobacco leaves can be changed by inserting a filter into the mouthpiece 110 as is evident from the function of the filter. 50 [0051] In the Examples of the present application, examples have been described in which the electric power for heating the heater 1 is supplied through the connector 6 from outside. However, it is evident that a disposable battery, if used as an electric power, can be built in the tool of the present application. It is also possible to build in a rechargeable battery to recharge using the connector 6. [0052] Further, the structure of the tool of the present invention is not limited to those described above. It is evident that the present invention covers a heater 1 which is not bent midway and has a straight shape for use, which only causes the tool 100 to have an elongated shape. 55 [0053] In addition, various structural items to allow a slender heater 1 to be directly inserted into a commercial cigarette or cigar can be devised from the tool of the present invention, not limited to the structures described above. 7",21

"1 EP 3 821 723 A1 2 Description TECHNICAL FIELD [0001] One or more exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure relate to an aerosol generating device, and more particularly, to an aerosol generating device having a structure that a user is unable to disassemble arbitrarily. BACKGROUND ART [0002] Recently, the demand for alternative methods to overcome the shortcomings of general cigarettes has increased. For example, there is an increasing demand for a method of generating aerosol by heating an aerosol generating material in cigarettes, rather than by burning cigarettes. Accordingly, studies on a heating-type ciga- rette or a heating-type aerosol generating device have been actively conducted. [0003] A non-combustion aerosol generating device refers to an apparatus which generates aerosols from an aerosol generating material included in a cigarette by heating the cigarette to a certain temperature without burning the cigarette, and allows a user to inhale the gen- erated aerosols with air. [0004] The non-combustion aerosol generating device is provided with a heater for heating the cigarette therein. Since the heater is heated to a high temperature, when the user disassembles the apparatus arbitrarily, the user may be easily exposed to a risk of being burned. [0005] It is to be appreciated that the above-described background art is technical information kept by the in- ventors to obtain exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure or acquired by the inventors in the process of obtaining the exemplary embodiments, thus the back- ground art may not have been known to the general public before the application of the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.

[0010] In an exemplary embodiment, the case may in- clude a seating portion protruding toward the hook por- tion to seat the cap. 15 [0011] In an exemplary embodiment, when the cap is installed in the case, the seating portion may be engaged with the locking jaw, thus restricting upward movement of the cap upward. 20 [0012] In an exemplary embodiment, the surface where the seating portion and the locking jaw contact each other may be extended in a direction parallel to the width direction of the cigarette. [0013] In an exemplary embodiment, the aerosol gen- erating device may further include a stopper that is in- 25 stalled on the inner surface of the case, presses the hook portion in the direction in which the locking jaw protrudes, and thus restricts movement of the hook portion in the direction in which the seating portion protrudes. [0014] In an exemplary embodiment, the locking jaw may include an inclined surface such that the seating portion slides on the inclined surface while the cap is being installed in the case. 30 [0015] In an exemplary embodiment, the seating por- tion may include a sliding surface such that the locking jaw slides on the sliding surface while the cap is being installed in the case. 35 [0016] In an exemplary embodiment, the aerosol gen- erating device may further include a sealing member in- terposed between the case and the cap to seal the inside 40 of the case. [0017] In an exemplary embodiment, the case includes an upper case where the cigarette is inserted and heated and a lower case supporting and protecting various com- ponents installed therein, wherein the contact surfaces of the upper case and the cap, and of the upper case and the lower case may be joined by ultrasonic welding. 45 [0006] One or more exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure provide an aerosol generating device having a structure that a user is unable to disassemble arbitrarily. [0018] In an exemplary embodiment, the hook portion further includes an extension member extending in the lengthwise direction of the cigarette further than the lock- ing jaw, and the stopper may press the extension member in the direction in which the locking jaw protrudes. [0019] In an exemplary embodiment, along the length- wise direction of the cigarette, the length of the extension member may be greater than the distance from the stop- per to the surface where the seating portion and the cap contact each other. 50 55 [0020] In an exemplary embodiment, along the length- wise direction of the cigarette, the width of the locking 2",39

FIG. 4 illustrates an example of the cigarette. FIG. 5 is a perspective view illustrating an operating state of the aerosol generating device according to an exemplary embodiment. 45 [0030] Hereinafter, the present disclosure will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure are shown such that one of ordinary skill in the art may easily work the present disclosure. The disclosure may, however, be embodied in many dif- ferent forms and should not be construed as being limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein. FIG. 6 is a perspective view illustrating an operating state in which some components are separated from the aerosol generating device, according to the ex- emplary embodiment shown in FIG. 5. FIG. 7 is an exploded perspective view illustrating some components of the aerosol generating device disassembled, according to the exemplary embodi- ment shown in FIG. 5. 50 [0031] Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with refer- ence to the drawings. FIG. 8 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a coupling relationship of some components of the aerosol gen- erating device, according to the exemplary embod- iment shown in FIG. 5. [0032] FIGS. 1 through 3 are diagrams showing exam- ples in which a cigarette is inserted into an aerosol gen- erating device. 3 55 [0033] Referring to FIG. 1, the aerosol generating de- vice 1000 may include a battery 1010, a controller 1020, and a heater 1030. Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, the aerosol FIG. 9 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a modified",40
"5 EP 3 821 723 A1 generating device 1000 may further include a vaporizer 1040. Also, the cigarette 2000 may be inserted into an inner space of the aerosol generating device 1000. [0034] FIGS. 1 through 3 illustrate components of the aerosol generating device 1000, which are related to the present embodiment. Therefore, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art related to the present em- bodiment that other general-purpose components may be further included in the aerosol generating device 1000, in addition to the components illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 3. [0035] Also, FIGS. 2 and 3 illustrate the aerosol gen- erating device 1000 including the heater 1030. However, according to necessity, the heater 1030 may be omitted. [0036] FIG. 1 illustrates that the battery 1010, the con- troller 1020, and the heater 1030 are arranged in series. Also, FIG. 2 illustrates that the battery 1010, the controller 1020, the vaporizer 1040, and the heater 1030 are ar- ranged in series. Also, FIG. 3 illustrates that the vaporizer 1040 and the heater 1030 are arranged in parallel. How- ever, the internal structure of the aerosol generating de- vice 1000 is not limited to the structures illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 3. In other words, according to the design of the aerosol generating device 1000, the battery 1010, the controller 1020, the heater 1030, and the vaporizer 1040 may be differently arranged. [0037] When the cigarette 2000 is inserted into the aer- osol generating device 1000, the aerosol generating de- vice 1000 may operate the heater 1030 and/or the va- porizer 1040 to generate an aerosol from the cigarette 2000 and/or the vaporizer 1040. The aerosol generated by the heater 1030 and/or the vaporizer 1040 is delivered to a user by passing through the cigarette 2000. [0038] According to necessity, even when the cigarette 2000 is not inserted into the aerosol generating device 1000, the aerosol generating device 1000 may heat the heater 1030. [0039] The battery 1010 may supply power to be used for the aerosol generating device 1000 to operate. For example, the battery 1010 may supply power to heat the heater 1030 or the vaporizer 1040, and may supply power for operating the controller 1020. Also, the battery 1010 may supply power for operations of a display, a sensor, a motor, etc. mounted in the aerosol generating device 1000 [0040] The controller 1020 may generally control op- erations of the aerosol generating device 1000. In detail, the controller 1020 may control not only operations of the battery 1010, the heater 1030, and the vaporizer 1040, but also operations of other components included in the aerosol generating device 1000. Also, the controller 1020 may check a state of each of the components of the aer- osol generating device 1000 to determine whether or not the aerosol generating device 1000 is able to operate. [0041] The controller 1020 may include at least one processor. A processor can be implemented as an array of a plurality of logic gates or can be implemented as a combination of a general-purpose microprocessor and a 6 memory in which a program executable in the microproc- essor is stored. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the processor can be implemented in other forms of hardware. 5 [0042] The heater 1030 may be heated by the power supplied from the battery 1010. For example, when the cigarette 2000 is inserted into the aerosol generating de- vice 1000, the heater 1030 may be located outside the cigarette 2000. Thus, the heated heater 1030 may in- 10 crease a temperature of an aerosol generating material in the cigarette 2000. [0043] The heater 1030 may include an electro-resis- tive heater. For example, the heater 1030 may include an electrically conductive track, and the heater 1030 may 15 be heated when currents flow through the electrically conductive track. However, the heater 1030 is not limited to the example described above and may include all heat- ers which may be heated to a desired temperature. Here, the desired temperature may be pre-set in the aerosol 20 generating device 1000 or may be set as a temperature desired by a user. [0044] As another example, the heater 1030 may in- clude an induction heater. In detail, the heater 1030 may include an electrically conductive coil for heating a ciga- rette in an induction heating method, and the cigarette may include a susceptor which may be heated by the induction heater. 25 [0045] For example, the heater 1030 may include a tube-type heating element, a plate-type heating element, a needle-type heating element, or a rod-type heating el- ement, and may heat the inside or the outside of the cigarette 2000, according to the shape of the heating element. 30 35 [0046] Also, the aerosol generating device 1000 may include a plurality of heaters 1030. Here, the plurality of heaters 1030 may be inserted into the cigarette 2000 or may be arranged outside the cigarette 2000. Also, some of the plurality of heaters 1030 may be inserted into the cigarette 2000 and the others may be arranged outside 40 the cigarette 2000. In addition, the shape of the heater 1030 is not limited to the shapes illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 3 and may include various shapes. 45 [0047] The vaporizer 1040 may generate an aerosol by heating a liquid composition and the generated aero- sol may pass through the cigarette 2000 to be delivered to a user. In other words, the aerosol generated via the vaporizer 1040 may move along an air flow passage of the aerosol generating device 1000 and the air flow pas- sage may be configured such that the aerosol generated via the vaporizer 1040 passes through the cigarette 2000 to be delivered to the user. 50 [0048] For example, the vaporizer 1040 may include a liquid storage, a liquid delivery element, and a heating element, but it is not limited thereto. For example, the liquid storage, the liquid delivery element, and the heating element may be included in the aerosol generating de- vice 1000 as independent modules. [0049] The liquid storage may store a liquid composi- 55 4",41
"7 EP 3 821 723 A1 tion. For example, the liquid composition may be a liquid including a tobacco-containing material having a volatile tobacco flavor component, or a liquid including a non- tobacco material. The liquid storage may be formed to be detachable from the vaporizer 1040 or may be formed integrally with the vaporizer 1040. [0050] For example, the liquid composition may in- clude water, a solvent, ethanol, plant extract, spices, fla- vorings, or a vitamin mixture. The spices may include menthol, peppermint, spearmint oil, and various fruit-fla- vored ingredients, but are not limited thereto. The flavor- ings may include ingredients capable of providing various flavors or tastes to a user. Vitamin mixtures may be a mixture of at least one of vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, and vitamin E, but are not limited thereto. Also, the liquid composition may include an aerosol forming substance, such as glycerin and propylene glycol. [0051] The liquid delivery element may deliver the liq- uid composition of the liquid storage to the heating ele- ment. For example, the liquid delivery element may be a wick such as cotton fiber, ceramic fiber, glass fiber, or porous ceramic, but is not limited thereto. [0052] The heating element is an element for heating the liquid composition delivered by the liquid delivery el- ement. For example, the heating element may be a metal heating wire, a metal hot plate, a ceramic heater, or the like, but is not limited thereto. In addition, the heating element may include a conductive filament such as ni- chrome wire and may be positioned as being wound around the liquid delivery element. The heating element may be heated by a current supply and may transfer heat to the liquid composition in contact with the heating ele- ment, thereby heating the liquid composition. As a result, aerosol may be generated. [0053] For example, the vaporizer 1040 may be re- ferred to as a cartomizer or an atomizer, but it is not limited thereto. [0054] The aerosol generating device 1000 may fur- ther include general-purpose components in addition to the battery 1010, the controller 1020, the heater 1030, and the vaporizer 1040. For example, the aerosol gen- erating device 1000 may include a display capable of outputting visual information and/or a motor for outputting haptic information. Also, the aerosol generating device 1000 may include at least one sensor (a puff detecting sensor, a temperature detecting sensor, a cigarette in- sertion detecting sensor, etc.). Also, the aerosol gener- ating device 1000 may be formed as a structure where, even when the cigarette 2000 is inserted into the aerosol generating device 1000, external air may be introduced or internal air may be discharged. [0055] Although not illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 3, the aerosol generating device 1000 and an additional cradle may form together a system. For example, the cradle may be used to charge the battery 1010 of the aerosol generating device 1000. Alternatively, the heater 1030 may be heated when the cradle and the aerosol generating device 1000 are coupled to each other. 8 [0056] The cigarette 2000 may be similar as a general combustive cigarette. For example, the cigarette 2000 may be divided into a first portion including an aerosol generating material and a second portion including a fil- 5 ter, etc. Alternatively, the second portion of the cigarette 2000 may also include an aerosol generating material. For example, an aerosol generating material made in the form of granules or capsules may be inserted into the second portion. 10 [0057] The entire first portion may be inserted into the aerosol generating device 1000, and the second portion may be exposed to the outside. Alternatively, only a por- tion of the first portion may be inserted into the aerosol generating device 1000. Otherwise, the entire first portion 15 and a portion of the second portion may be inserted into the aerosol generating device 1000. The user may puff aerosol while holding the second portion by the mouth of the user. In this case, the aerosol is generated by the external air passing through the first portion, and the gen- 20 erated aerosol passes through the second portion and is delivered to the user's mouth. [0058] For example, the external air may flow into at least one air passage formed in the aerosol generating device 1000. For example, opening and closing of the air passage and/or a size of the air passage may be adjusted by the user. Accordingly, the amount of smoke and a smoking satisfaction may be adjusted by the user. As another example, the external air may flow into the cig- arette 2000 through at least one hole formed in a surface of the cigarette 2000. 25 30 [0059] Hereinafter, an example of the cigarette 2000 will be described with reference to FIG. 4. [0060] FIG. 4 illustrates an example of a cigarette. [0061] Referring to FIG. 4, the cigarette 2000 may in- clude a tobacco rod 2050 and a filter rod 2200. The first portion described above with reference to FIGS. 1 through 3 may include the tobacco rod 2050, and the second portion may include the filter rod 2200. 35 [0062] FIG. 4 illustrates that the filter rod 2200 includes 40 a single segment. However, the filter rod 2200 is not lim- ited thereto. In other words, the filter rod 2200 may in- clude a plurality of segments. For example, the filter rod 2200 may include a first segment configured to cool aer- osol and a second segment configured to filter a certain component included in the aerosol. Also, as necessary, the filter rod 2200 may further include at least one seg- ment configured to perform other functions. 45 50 [0063] The cigarette 2000 may be packaged using at least one wrapper 2350. The wrapper 2350 may have at least one hole through which external air may be intro- duced or internal air may be discharged. For example, the cigarette 2000 may be packaged using one wrapper 2350. As another example, the cigarette 2000 may be double-packaged using at least two wrappers 2350. For example, the tobacco rod 2050 may be packaged using a first wrapper, and the filter rod 2200 may be packaged using a second wrapper. Also, the tobacco rod 2050 and the filter rod 2200, which are respectively packaged using 55 5",42
"9 EP 3 821 723 A1 separate wrappers, may be coupled to each other, and the entire cigarette 2000 may be packaged using a third wrapper. When each of the tobacco rod 2050 and the filter rod 2200 includes a plurality of segments, each seg- ment may be packaged using a separate wrapper. Also, the entire cigarette 2000 including the plurality of seg- ments, which are respectively packaged using the sep- arate wrappers may be combined and re-packaged to- gether using another wrapper. [0064] The tobacco rod 2050 may include an aerosol generating material. For example, the aerosol generating material may include at least one of glycerin, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, and oleyl alcohol, but it is not limited thereto. Also, the tobacco rod 2050 may include other additives, such as flavors, a wet- ting agent, and/or organic acid. Also, the tobacco rod 2050 may include a flavored liquid, such as menthol or a moisturizer, which is injected to the tobacco rod 2050. [0065] The tobacco rod 2050 may be manufactured in various forms. For example, the tobacco rod 2050 may be formed as a sheet or a strand. Also, the tobacco rod 2050 may be formed as a pipe tobacco, which is formed of tiny bits cut from a tobacco sheet. Also, the tobacco rod 2050 may be surrounded by a heat conductive ma- terial. For example, the heat-conducting material may be, but is not limited to, a metal foil such as aluminum foil. For example, the heat conductive material surround- ing the tobacco rod 2050 may uniformly distribute heat transmitted to the tobacco rod 2050, and thus, the heat conductivity applied to the tobacco rod may be increased and taste of the tobacco may be improved. Also, the heat conductive material surrounding the tobacco rod 2050 may function as a susceptor heated by the induction heat- er. Here, although not illustrated in the drawings, the to- bacco rod 2050 may further include an additional sus- ceptor, in addition to the heat conductive material sur- rounding the tobacco rod 2050. [0066] The filter rod 2200 may include a cellulose ac- etate filter. Shapes of the filter rod 2200 are not limited. For example, the filter rod 2200 may include a cylinder- type rod or a tube-type rod having a hollow inside. Also, the filter rod 2200 may include a recess-type rod. When the filter rod 2200 includes a plurality of segments, at least one of the plurality of segments may have a different shape. 10 [0067] The filter rod 2200 may be formed to generate flavors. For example, a flavoring liquid may be injected onto the filter rod 2200, or an additional fiber coated with a flavoring liquid may be inserted into the filter rod 2200. 50 [0068] Also, the filter rod 2200 may include at least one capsule 2300. Here, the capsule 2300 may generate a flavor or aerosol. For example, the capsule 2300 may have a configuration in which a liquid containing a flavor- ing material is wrapped with a film. For example, the cap- sule 2300 may have a spherical or cylindrical shape, but is not limited thereto. configured to cool the aerosol, the cooling segment may include a polymer material or a biodegradable polymer material. For example, the cooling segment may include pure polylactic acid alone, but the material for forming 5 the cooling segment is not limited thereto. In some ex- emplary embodiments, the cooling segment may include a cellulose acetate filter having a plurality of holes. How- ever, the cooling segment is not limited to the above- described example and any other cooling segment that is capable of cooling the aerosol may be used. 10 [0070] Although not illustrated in FIG. 4, the cigarette 2000 according to an exemplary embodiment may further include a front-end filter. The front-end filter may be lo- cated on a side of the tobacco rod 2050, which is the side 15 not facing the filter rod 2200. The front-end filter may prevent the tobacco rod 2050 from being detached out- wards and prevent the liquefied aerosol from flowing into the aerosol generating device 1000 (FIGS. 1 through 3) from the tobacco rod 2050, during smoking. 20 [0071] FIG. 5 is a perspective view illustrating an op- erating state of the aerosol generating device according to an exemplary embodiment. [0072] The aerosol generating device 1000 according to the exemplary embodiments shown in FIG. 5 may in- clude a casing 1100 and a cover 1002. The cover 1002 is coupled with a first end of the casing 1100, and thus the cover 1002 forms the outer appearance of the aerosol generating device 1000 together with the casing 1100. [0073] The casing 1100 forms the outer appearance of the aerosol generating device 1000 and functions to accommodate and protect various components in a space formed therein. 25 30 [0074] The cover 1002 and the casing 1100 may in- clude a plastic material with low heat conductivity or a metal coated with a heat barrier material on its surface. The cover 1002 and the casing 1100 may be fabricated through, for example, an injection molding method, a 3D printing method, or a method of assembling small parts fabricated through injection molding. 35 40 [0075] A maintaining device may be installed between the cover 1002 and the casing 1100 to maintain the cou- pling of the cover 1002 and the casing 1100. The main- taining device may include, for example, a protrusion and a groove. The coupling of the cover 1002 and the casing 1100 may be maintained by maintaining a state that pro- trusion is inserted in the groove. The protrusion may be moved by a manipulation button that may be pressed by a user and separated from the groove. 45 [0076] The maintaining device may also include, for example, a magnet and a metal member that sticks to the magnet. When a magnet is used for the maintaining device, a magnet may be installed on either the cover 1002 or the casing 1100, and a metal that sticks to the magnet may be attached to the other one. Alternatively, magnets may be installed on both the cover 1002 and the casing 1100. [0069] When the filter rod 2200 includes a segment 55 [0077] In the aerosol generating device 1000 accord- ing to the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 5, the 6",43
"11 EP 3 821 723 A1 cover 1002 may be omitted as necessary. 12 [0078] An outside hole 1002p through which the ciga- rette 2000 may be inserted is formed on the top surface of the cover 1002 coupled with the casing 1100. Also, a rail 1003r is formed on the top surface of the cover 1002 at a position adjacent to the outside hole 1002p. A door 1003 slidable along the top surface of the cover 1002 is installed on the rail 1003r. The door 1003 may slide in a straight line along the rail 1003r. [0088] The cleaning operation of the aerosol generat- ing device 1000 may be performed as follows: The user exposes internal space, the heater 1030, and the like of the aerosol generating device 1000 to the outside by sep- arating the cover 1002 from the case 1100 of the aerosol generating device 1000 and separating a cigarette sup- port 4 from the case 1100, so that the tobacco residue may be removed. 5 [0079] As the door 1003 moves along the rail 1003r in the direction indicated by the arrow in FIG. 5, the outside hole 1002p and an insertion hole 1004p that enable the cigarette 2000 to be inserted into the casing 1100 through the cover 1002 are exposed to the outside. The outside hole 1002p of the cover 1002 exposes the insertion hole 1004p of an accommodating path 1004h for accommo- dating the cigarette 2000 to the outside. 10 [0089] In detail, the case 1100 may include an upper case 1100a into which the cigarette 2000 is inserted and heated, and a lower case 1100b for supporting and pro- tecting the various components installed therein. The case 1100 refers to both the upper case 1100a and the lower case 1100b hereinafter. 15 [0090] The cover 1002 may be coupled to the case 1100 to cover the cigarette support 4 coupled to the case 1100. Alternatively, the cover 1002 may be separated from the case 1100 if necessary. [0080] When the outside hole 1002p is exposed to the outside by the door 1003, a user may insert an end portion 2000b of the cigarette 2000 into the outside hole 1002p and the insertion hole 1004p, thereby placing the ciga- rette 2000 in the accommodating path 1004h formed in- side the cover 1002. [0091] After finishing the cigarette 2000, the user may 20 take the cigarette 2000 out of the case 1100 by rotating the cigarette 2000 with a hand to remove the cigarette 2000 from the aerosol generating device 1000. [0081] In the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 5, the door 1003 is installed to move in a straight line with respect to the cover 1002. However, the structure in which the door 1003 is coupled with the cover 1002 is not limited thereto. For example, the door 1003 may be rotatably mounted on the cover 1002 through a hinge assembly. In case of employing a hinge assembly, the door 1003 may be rotated along an extension of the top surface of the cover or the door 1003 may be rotated in a direction away from the top surface of the cover 1002. [0082] The rail 1003r has a concave groove shape, but the exemplary embodiment is not limited thereto. For ex- ample, the rail 1003r may have a convex shape or may extend in a curve instead of a straight line. [0083] At the casing 1100, a button 1009 is provided. As the button 1009 is manipulated, the operation of the aerosol generating device 1000 may be controlled. [0084] An outside air introduction gap 1002g that al- lows the air to flow into the interior of the cover 1002 is formed at a portion where the cover 1002 meets the cas- ing 1100 when the cover 1002 is coupled with the casing 1100. [0092] Alternatively, as illustrated in FIG. 6, when the user rotates the cigarette 2000 and pulls the cover 1002, the cover 1002 may be separated from the case 1100 together with the cigarette 2000, and thus the cigarette 2000 may be removed from the aerosol generating de- vice 1000. 25 30 [0093] In other words, the cigarette 2000 and the heat- er 1030 may be decoupled, and at the same time, the tobacco residue attached to the cigarette 2000 may be taken out of the case 1100 together with the cigarette 2000 by rotating the cigarette 2000 and separating it from the case 1100. 35 [0094] When the user pulls the cover 1002 without ro- tating the cigarette 2000, the cigarette 2000 may be sep- arated from the case 1100 but part of the cigarette, such as tobacco substances, may still remain in the heater 1030. In that case, the user may separate the cover 1002 40 from the case 1100, and separate the cigarette support 4 from the case 1100. As such, the tobacco substances remaining in the heater 1030 are separated from the case 1100 together with the cigarette support 4. Then, the user may remove the tobacco substances remaining in the cigarette support 4. 7 45 [0095] FIG. 7 is an exploded perspective view illustrat- ing some components of the aerosol generating device disassembled, according to the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 5. FIG. 8 is a cross-sectional view illus- trating a coupling relationship of some components of the aerosol generating device, according to the exem- plary embodiment shown in FIG. 5. [0085] FIG. 6 is a perspective view illustrating an op- erating state in which some components are separated from the aerosol generating device, according to the ex- emplary embodiment shown in FIG. 5. [0086] As illustrated in FIG. 6, aerosol may be inhaled by the user holding the cigarette 2000 by mouth while the cigarette 2000 is inserted in the aerosol generating device 1000. 50 [0096] The aerosol generating device 1000 includes the case 1100, a bracket 1200, a fastening member 1300, and a cap 1400, according to the exemplary embodi- ments shown in FIGS. 7 and 8. [0097] The heater 1030 may be installed in the case 1100 to heat the cigarette 2000. As described above, the [0087] When the cigarette 2000 is finished, the user may remove the cigarette 2000 from the aerosol gener- 55 ating device 1000 and perform a cleaning operation to remove tobacco residue that may remain in the aerosol generating device 1000.",44
"13 EP 3 821 723 A1 14 case 1100 may include the upper case 1100a and the lower case 1100b. The fastening member 1300, the cap 1400, and a sealing member 1600, which will be de- scribed later, may be installed in the upper case 1100a. [0098] The bracket 1200 may support the various com- ponents installed in the case 1100. For example, the bracket 1200 fixes electronic components for supplying power to the heater 1030, such as the battery 1010 and the controller 1020, to the lower case 1100b and protects the electronic components. [0099] The fastening member 1300 may fasten the case 1100 and the bracket 1200. It is desirable that the fastening member 1300 may include at least one screw, as shown in FIG. 7. In detail, a screw hole (not shown) into which the fastening member 1300 is inserted may be formed in the case 1100, and a coupling hole (not shown) to which the screw hole is connected may be formed in the bracket 1200. The screw is fastened to the screw hole and the coupling hole by penetrating both the screw hole and the coupling hole. Thus, the case 1100 and the bracket 1200 may be fastened to each other. [0100] The cap 1400 is installed on the outer surface of the case 1100 to conceal the fastening member 1300 in the case 1100 and may be inseparable after installa- tion. Here, the expression 'inseparable after installation' means that the cap 1400 is not easily separated by a general user unless specially manufactured equipment is used. However, exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto. In addition, the expression 'inseparable after installation' means that the cap 1400 may be separated exceptionally when specially manufactured equipment is used, and also means that, when deformation of any one component or of a plurality of components of the aerosol generating device 1000 like a breakdown of a hook portion 1410 to be described herein below occurs, the cap 1400 may be forcibly sep- arated. [0101] Referring to FIG. 8, the cap 1400 includes the hook portion 1410 protruding in the lengthwise direction of the cigarette 2000, wherein the hook portion 1410 may include a locking jaw 1411 protruding toward the inner surface of the case 1100. [0102] The case 1100 may include a seating portion 1110 protruding toward the hook portion 1410 to seat the cap 1400. When the cap 1400 is installed in the case 1100, the seating portion 1110 may be engaged with the locking jaw 1411, thus restricting upward movement of the cap 1400. For example, surface 1411p where the seating portion 1110 and the locking jaw 1411 contact each other may be extended in a direction parallel with the width direction of the cigarette. Given this structure, even when the user arbitrarily lifts the cap 1400 upward, the locking jaw 1411 of the cap 1400 may be caught by the seating portion 1110 of the case 1100, and thus the cap 1400 is unable to move upward. [0103] In addition, the aerosol generating device 1000 may further include a stopper 1500 that is installed on the inner surface of the case 1100. The stopper 1500 presses the hook portion 1410 in the direction in which the locking jaw 1411 protrudes, and thus restricts move- ment of the hook portion 1410 in the direction in which the seating portion 1110 protrudes. Given this structure, 5 if the user arbitrarily lifts the cap 1400 upward the locking jaw 1411 may be fixed in place by the stopper 1500 and thus prevented from sliding with respect to the seating portion 1110. As a result, the cap 1400 may be prevented from being lifted upward and separated from the case 1100. 10 [0104] The locking jaw 1411 may include an inclined surface 1411s which allows the seating portion 1110 to slide while the cap 1400 is installed in the case 1100. The seating portion 1110 may include a sliding surface 15 1110s which allows the locking jaw 1411 to slide while the cap 1400 is installed in the case 1100. [0105] Given this structure, the cap 1400 may be in- stalled in the case 1100 in a convenient and effective manner. In the process of installing the cap 1400 in the case 1100, the inclined surface 1411s of the locking jaw 1411 and the sliding surface 1110s of the seating portion 1110 slide on each other, and thus the hook portion 1410 of the cap 1400 may be deformed at a certain interval toward the center of the case 1100. Depending on such 20 25 deformation, the hook portion 1410 may continue to be inserted downward. [0106] After the locking jaw 1411 of the hook portion 1410 is inserted downward further than the seating por- tion 1110 of the case 1100, the hook portion 1410 returns to its original place, and thus the locking jaw 1411 and the seating portion 1110 may be fitted to each other. [0107] Given the structure as described above, al- though the cap 1400 may be installed in the case 1100 in a simple manner, the user may not manipulate the cap 1400 arbitrarily or separate the cap 1400 from the case 1100. Since the user is unable to have access to the fastening member 1300 installed in the case 1100, it is impossible for the user to have access to the bracket 1200 fastened to the case 1100 by the fastening member 30 35 40 1300. In addition, since the user is unable to disassemble the aerosol generating device 1000 arbitrarily and have access to various electronic components or the heater 1030 installed therein, problems like burns from the heat- er 1030 heated to a high temperature and breakdowns 45 of the electronic components due to inadvertent opera- tions may be prevented. [0108] The aerosol generating device 1000 may fur- ther include the sealing member 1600 interposed be- tween the case 1100 and the cap 1400 to seal the inside 50 of the case 1100. It is desirable that the sealing member 1600 be made of a material having a certain level of elas- ticity, like rubber. The sealing member 1600 may prevent the inside of the case 1100 from being contaminated by foreign substances flowing between the case 1100 and the cap 1400. 55 [0109] Interspace between the upper case 1100a and the cap 1400, where the sealing member 1600 is in- stalled, and a contact surface UM between the upper 8",45
"15 EP 3 821 723 A1 16 case 1100a and the lower case 1100b may be processed by ultrasonic welding. Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto. Additionally, all portions where different components are connected may be joined to each other using ultrasonic welding. In other words, for the purpose of preventing the user from arbitrarily accessing the heater 1030 or the electronic components in the apparatus, all the contact portions needing to be sealed may be joined to each other by ultrasonic welding. Since the portions joined by ultrasonic welding are connected to each other by a rigid body, the user is unable to arbitrarily separate or open the portions unless the user breaks the portions forcibly. [0110] FIG. 9 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a modified example of some components of the aerosol generating device shown in FIG. 8. [0111] Referring to FIG. 9, a hook portion 2410 of the aerosol generating device includes an extension mem- ber 2412 extending in the lengthwise direction of the cig- arette further than a locking jaw 2411. Also, the stopper 2500 may press the extension member 2412 in the di- rection in which the locking jaw 2411 protrudes. [0112] Given the structure as described above, along the lengthwise direction of the cigarette 2000, length (b) of the extension member 2412 may be greater than dis- tance (f) from the stopper 2500 to the surface where an upper surface of a seating portion 2110 and a cap 2400 contact each other (that is, b> f). [0113] Thatis because, if the length (b) of the extension member 2412, along the lengthwise direction of the cig- arette 2000, is less than or equal to the distance (f) from the stopper 2500 to the surface where the upper surface of the seating portion 2110 and the cap 2400 contact each other (that is, b <= f), in the process of inserting the cap 2400 between the seating portion 2110 and the stop- per 2500, the locking jaw 2411 may move to the left by a certain distance, sliding with respect to the seating por- tion 2110. As a result, the extension member 2412 moves to the left further than the stopper 2500, thus the exten- sion member 2412 may not be inserted into the space between the seating portion 2110 and the stopper 2500. [0114] In addition, along the lengthwise direction of the cigarette 2000, width (a) of the locking jaw 2411 may be less than or equal to distance (e) from the surface 2411p where the locking jaw 2411 and the seating portion 2110 engage with each other to the stopper 2500 (that is, a <= e). [0115] That is because, if the width (a) of the locking jaw 2411, along the lengthwise direction of the cigarette 2000, is greater than the distance (e) from the surface 2411p where the locking jaw 2411 and the seating portion 2110 engage with each other to the stopper 2500, in the process of inserting the hook portion 2410 between the seating portion 2110 and the stopper 2500, the path where the locking jaw 2411 and the seating portion 2110 slide with each other may be extended, and as a conse- quence, the seating portion 2110 or the cap 2400 may be damaged. [0116] In addition, along the width direction of the cig- arette 2000, width (c) of the hook portion 2410 excluding the locking jaw 2411 may be less than distance (g) from the stopper 2500 to the locking jaw 2411, (that is, c < g). 5 [0117] That is because, when the width (c) of the hook portion 2410 excluding the locking jaw 2411, along the width direction of the cigarette 2000, is greater than or equal to the distance (g) from the stopper 2500 to the locking jaw 2411 (that is, c >= g), the arrangement struc- 10 ture of the hook portion 2410, the seating portion 2110, and the stopper 2500 may not be implemented as shown in FIG. 9. In addition, in the process of inserting the ex- tension member 2412 into the space between the seating portion 2110 and the stopper 2500, the hook portion 2410 15 may not be upright, and thus the cap 2400 may not be installed in the case 2100. [0118] Also, along the width direction of the cigarette 2000, width (d) of the hook portion 2410 including the locking jaw 2411 may be greater than the distance (g) from the stopper 2500 to the locking jaw 2411, (that is, d > g). 20 [0119] That is because, if the width (d) of the hook por- tion 2410 including the locking jaw 2411, along the width direction of the cigarette 2000, is less than or equal to the distance (g) from the stopper 2500 to the locking jaw 2411 (that is, d <= g), the hook portion 2410 may easily slip into the space between the seating portion 2110 and the stopper 2500. 25 30 [0120] While exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure have been illustrated and described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, it will be clear that the present disclosure is not limited to these exemplary embodiments only. Numerous modifications, changes, variations, substitutions, and equivalents will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Thus, it is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with the true scope and spirit of the dis- closure being indicated by the appended claims. 35 40 EMBODIMENTS: [0121] 45 1.

Rep. of Germany .. 206/256 Primary Examiner-Stephen Marcus [57] ABSTRACT The common cigarettes in cigarette packs and boxes are individually wrapped by a thin foil-type wrapping ma- terial and each is totally sealed from all four sides to preserve tobacco freshness and aroma and to prevent tobacco brittleness if the cigarettes are stored for ex- tended period of time or if the cigarette package is opened but the contents are consumed long time after the opening. The cigarettes are packed in flexible strips having flexible foldings which allow compacting the cigarettes for packaging in the least volume and allow the separation of individual cigarettes without breaking the total seal of any adjacent cigarettes. With the ciga- rettes sealed inside the strip, the usual aluminum foil- type lining of the cigarette box is no longer needed. The cigarette strips are then packaged inside a soft package or flip-top box having perforated slots on one of its surfaces to allow the easy opening of the package for pulling of one end of the strip for separation of one or more cigarettes for consumption without destroying either the package or the seal of the remaining ciga- rettes. 2 Claims, 2 Drawing Sheets IO II",64

The cigarette strips are then packaged inside soft packs or flip-top boxes, as commonly used. The strips 5 may be packed in one piece containing the desired num- ber of cigarettes in a package, or cut into strips of smaller numbers of cigarettes which then should add up to the designated number printed on the package. These soft and flip-top boxes have lines of weakness (perfora- 10 tion) on their surfaces such as to allow the easy make of an opening on each package through a gentle pull or pushing action. This opening is then used to pull one tip end of the cigarette strip from inside the package. Once the tip end of the cigarette strip is reached, one or more Cigarettes in cigarette packages are usually shipped overseas or consumed locally after long months of stor- age and transportations. It is not unusual that some packages are consumed one or two years after manufac- turing. The tobacco in these cigarettes usually loses its aroma and becomes brittle and dry due to the evapora- tion of its aromic oils. The existing art of individual cigarette packaging offers cumbersome packaging that necessitates elaborate cigarette boxes with serrated knives, or cigarette strips that are hard and rigid. One 15 number of cigarettes can be separated from the rest of the strip by pulling along the line of perforation on the strip. The remaining cigarettes are still fully sealed and can be consumed any long time later without loss in tobacco freshness.

"5,613,505 1 INDUCTIVE HEATING SYSTEMS FOR SMOKING ARTICLES CROSS-RELATED APPLICATIONS 2 The present application is a continuation-in-part of com- monly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/105,346, filed Aug. 10, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,479,948, issued Jan. 2, 1996, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/118, 665, filed Sep. 10, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,388,594, 10 issued Feb. 14, 1995, and to its parent U.S. patent applica- tion Ser. No. 07/943,504, filed Sep. 11, 1992, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,505,214, issued Apr. 9, 1996, which are hereby incorporated by reference. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/118,665, filed Sep. 10, 1993, describes an electrical smoking system including a novel electrically powered lighter and novel cigarette that is adapted to cooperate with the lighter. The preferred embodi- ment of the lighter includes a plurality of metallic sinusoidal heaters disposed in a configuration that receives, via inser- tion, a tobacco rod portion of the cigarette. 5 The preferred embodiment of the cigarette of Ser. No. 08/118,665 preferably comprises a tobacco-laden tubular carrier, cigarette paper overwrapped about the tubular car- rier, an arrangement of flow-through filter plugs at a mouth- piece end of the carrier and a filter plug at the opposite (distal) end of the carrier, which preferably limits air flow axially through the cigarette. The cigarette and the lighter are configured such that when the cigarette is inserted into the lighter and as individual heaters are activated for each puff, localized charring occurs at spots about the cigarette in the locality where each heater was bearing against the cigarette. Once all the heaters have been activated, these charred spots are closely spaced from one another and encircle a central portion of the carrier portion of the cigarette. Depending on the maximum temperatures and total energies delivered at the heaters, the charred spots manifest more than mere discolorations of the cigarette paper. In most applications, the charring will create at least minute breaks in the cigarette paper and the underlying carrier material, which breaks tends to mechanically weaken the cigarette. For the cigarette to be withdrawn from the lighter, the charred spots must be at least partially slid past the heaters. In aggravated circumstances, such as when the cigarette is wet or toyed with or twisted, the cigarette may be prone to break or leave pieces upon its withdrawal from the lighter. Pieces left in the lighter fixture can interfere with the proper operation of the lighter and/or deliver an off-taste to the smoke of the next cigarette. If the cigarette breaks in two while being withdrawn, the smoker may be faced not only with the frustration of failed cigarette product, but also with the prospect of clearing debris from a clogged lighter before he or she can enjoy another cigarette. 15 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Technical Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to heating systems for electrically powered smoking articles and more particu- 20 larly to inductive heating systems for electrically powered smoking articles. 2. Discussion of the Related Art Previously known more conventional smoking devices deliver flavor and aroma to the user as a result of combus- tion. A mass of combustible material, primarily tobacco, is combusted and adjacent portion of material is pyrolized as the result of applied heat drawn therethrough, with typical combustion temperatures in a more conventional cigarette being in excess of 800° C. during puffing. During this heating, inefficient oxidation of the combustible material takes place and yields various distillation and pyrolysis products. As these products are drawn through the body of the smoking device toward the mouth of the user, they cool and condense to form an aerosol or vapor which gives the consumer the flavor and aroma associated with smoking. 25 30 35 Conventional cigarettes have various perceived draw- backs associated with them. Among them is the production of sidestream smoke during smoldering between puffs, which may be objectionable to some non-smokers. Also, once lit, they must be fully consumed or be discarded. Relighting a conventional cigarette is possible but is usually an unattractive prospect for subjective reasons (flavor, taste, odor) to a discerning smoker. 40 The preferred embodiment of the cigarette of Ser. No. 08/118,665 is essentially a hollow tube between the filter plugs at the mouthpiece end of the cigarette and the plug at the distal end. This construction is believed to elevate delivery to the smoker by providing sufficient space into which aerosol can evolve off the carrier with minimal 45 impingement and condensation of the aerosol on any nearby surfaces. However, the hollow construction is susceptible to being bent or folded, crushed, collapsed and/or torn through handling. The structure also is vulnerable to damage during 50 cigarette making and packing, particularly in modern, high speed cigarette making and packing machines. A prior alternative to the more conventional cigarettes include those in which the combustible material itself does not directly provide the flavorants to the aerosol inhaled by the smoker. In these smoking articles, a combustible heating element, typically carbonaceous in nature, is combusted to heat air as it is drawn over the heating element and through a zone which contains heat-activated elements that release a flavored aerosol. While this type of smoking device pro- duces little or no sidestream smoke, it still generates prod- ucts of combustion, and once lit it is not adapted to be snuffed for future use in the conventional sense. It is desirable to reduce or eliminate the need for contact between the tobacco flavor medium, and any associated structure, and relatively fragile heating elements to mini- mize disruption or termination of the heating system as the numerous tobacco medium products are inserted, adjusted during use, and removed. It is also important to provide uniform heat for successive firings of a smoking article. Also, heating systems which require thermal contact or close 55 Commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,093,894; 5,225,498; 5,060,671 and 5,095,921 disclose various heating elements and flavor generating articles which significantly reduce sidestream smoke while permitting the smoker to selectively 60 thermal registry between heater elements and the tobacco suspend and reinitiate smoking. However, the cigarette articles disclosed in these patents are not very durable and may collapse, tear or break from extended or heavy han- dling. In certain circumstances, these prior cigarette articles may crush as they are inserted into the electric lighters. Once 65 they are smoked, they are even weaker and may tear or break as they are removed from the lighter. flavor medium necessitate precise manufacturing tolerances which may be difficult or economically unfeasible to achieve and/or maintain at high mass production rates. In addition, it is always desirable to improve the heating efficiency of heating systems, thereby reducing power consumption of the smoking article and the mass of the power source. Further, conductive and/or convective heating of a tobacco flavor",89

An induction source produces an alter- 45 FIG. 12C further comprising an additional support strip; nating electromagnetic (EM)field which induces a heat generating eddy current in a susceptor.

Alter- natively, a single induction source and cylinder are trans- 55 lated axially relative to one another. Alternatively, a movable substrate containing tobacco flavor medium, e.g., a web, is registered with a relatively stationary induction source. The induction source either inductively heats susceptor materials mixed with or layered on the tobacco flavor medium or 60 inductively heats a distinct susceptor element in thermal proximity to the tobacco flavor medium.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 65 Induction heating is a known phenomenon described by Faraday's law of induction and Ohm's law. More specifi- cally, Faraday's law of induction states that if the magnetic FIG. 1 is an exposed side view of E-shaped induction heating source shown in conjunction with a cylindrically",90
"5,613,505 5 6 induction ß in a conductor is changing, a changing electric field E is produced in the conductor. Since this electric field E is produced in a conductor, a current, known as an eddy current, will flow in the conductor according to Ohm's law. The eddy current will generate heat proportional to the current density and the conductor resistivity. A conductor which is capable of being inductively heated is known as a susceptor. The present invention employs an inductive heat- ing source which generates an alternating magnetic field ß from an AC source such as an LC circuit. More specifically, an EM field is produced. The produced field will be referred to as a magnetic field since this component is believed to be the agent of the induction heating of the susceptor. Heat generating eddy currents are then generated in a susceptor which is either part of the tobacco flavor medium delivery system or a distinct element in thermal proximity thereto. The primary heat transfer mechanisms for the susceptor to the tobacco medium are, in order of effect, conduction, radiation and possibly convection. Conduction is the pri- mary heat transfer mechanism. entially around the cylindrical cigarette C, comprised of tobacco flavor medium, in a substantially planar relation- ship. Although six induction sources 10 are shown in FIG. 3, the preferred number of induction sources in this embodi- ment is equal to the desired number of puffs to be generated by heating the cigarette, e.g., six, seven, eight, nine or more. Each induction source is configured to generate an alternat- ing magnetic field in response to a signal indicating that the smoker is drawing on the article. The respective firings of an inductive source can be in a sequential order around the circumference or in any other desired pattern, such as firing a first induction source, followed by the oppositely located induction source, followed by the induction source next to the first source, and so forth, to minimize undesired heat transfer to portions the cigarette which are not intended to be heated, i.e., non-""target"" areas. As a result, longitudinally extending portions of the tube of tobacco flavor medium are heated evenly around the tube. In an alternative embodi- ment, the circumferentially arranged induction sources 10 can be staggered relative to longitudinal axis of the cigarette. For example, the induction sources 10 can be spiraled around to the cigarette. As a result, staggered, longitudinally extending portions of the tube of tobacco flavor medium are heated. 5 10 15 The tobacco flavor medium used in the present invention 20 is defined in greater detail in the parent and related appli- cations and comprises tobacco, reconstituted tobacco, com- binations thereof, etc., which can be heated to evolve desired flavors. An eddy current can not be induced in such tobacco flavor medium because tobacco is considered a dielectric. 25 More specifically, tobacco has a high specific resistivity and low magnetic permeability. Accordingly, a susceptor is employed which is in thermal proximity with the tobacco flavor medium, i.e., the susceptor is positioned relative to the tobacco flavor medium to transfer an adequate amount of heat to the tobacco flavor medium to evolve the desired flavors. For example, the susceptor can be a distinct element which is close enough to the tobacco flavor medium to transfer heat thereto, a layer of susceptor material in thermal proximity to the tobacco flavor medium, or a discontinuous 35 susceptor material layered on, interspersed in, or surrounded by the tobacco flavor medium, as described below. Another embodiment of the induction source is shown in FIGS. 4 and 5. Cylindrical induction source 100 comprises a plurality of individual, generally circular induction sources 102 separated and magnetically insulated from one another by respective annular shields 114. An outer shield 110 can be a split stainless steel magnetic collar encircling all of the induction sources 102 and the plurality of distinct shield rings 114 which respectively separate the adjacent induction sources 102. The number of discrete induction sources 102 preferably equals the number of desired puffs to be gener- ated from a cigarette C inserted in the hollow cylindrical cavity defined by cylindrical induction source 100. Each induction source 102 comprises a separate winding of wires 104 forming an excitation coil about the inserted cigarette and connected to an appropriate alternating magnetic field generating circuit. Each induction source 102 further com- prises a respective pole piece ring 106 of a material such as ferrite material which collapses the generated magnetic field ß inward toward the inserted cigarette. 30 For example, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the induction heating source 10 may comprise an appropriately shaped pole piece 11 composed of ferrite or other magnetically 40 permeable material having a current bearing wire or exci- tation coil 12 wrapped around a portion thereof to form a toroid. The current bearing wire 12 is connected to an alternating current circuit 14. The induction source 10 may be shaped as an E, as shown in FIG. 1, with the wire 12 spiraled around the center leg 20 located between, and extending in the same direction as, two end legs or as a squared C, as shown in FIG. 2, with the wire 12 spiraled along the middle section 30 between the two perpendicularly extending legs 32 and 34. Alternatively, the pole piece 50 comprises a rod encircled by an excitation coil. The circuit may be any appropriate circuit LC connected to a battery or other source of electrical power, as discussed in greater detail below. The induction heating source will accordingly form an alternating magnetic field. In the case of the E-shaped pole piece of FIG. 1, the magnetic field ß lines will extend from the center leg to each respective end leg, forming two respective arcs composed of a plurality of field lines. Accordingly, the magnetic field is self sealing between A thin inner cylindrical wall 120 separates the magnetic field collapsing rings 106 and the adjacent shield rings 114 from the inserted cigarette C. Wall 120 holds the cigarette C and permits air to be ported to the cigarette. Wall 120 can be a suitable material having a low magnetic permeability, and a corresponding high reluctance corresponding to air, such as polyether(ether)ketone or PEEK® polymer commercially available from Imperial Chemical Industries of Great Brit- ain. The cylindrical tube 100, ferrite pole piece rings 106, excitation coils, shield rings 114 and the inserted cigarette C are coaxial. 45 55 A single induction source 102 is activated as discussed, causing an alternating current to flow in the excitation coil formed by wound wire 104 and thus generating an alternate magnetic field which is collapsed inward and through wall 120 by the particular pole piece ring 106, and toward a the legs. In the case of C-shape pole piece of FIG. 2, the 60 portion of the inserted cigarette C substantially underlying, magnetic field lines will extend between the end legs in an arc comprising a plurality of field lines and is self-sealed. This generated alternating magnetic field will induce eddy currents within appropriately positioned susceptors, as dis- cussed below. or encircled by, the first pole piece ring 106. Shield rings 114 located on each side of each excitation coil shield adjacent induction sources 102 from the generated magnetic field, minimize magnetic field lines undesirably impinging on, and thus heating, portions of the cigarette other than the target portion substantially underlying the fired induction source 102, and increase the strength of the magnetic field collapsed 65 As best seen in FIG. 3, in one embodiment a plurality of induction sources 10 are employed and arranged circumfer-",91
"5,613,505 7 8 onto the underlying cigarette portion. As shown, a gap may be present between wall 120 and the inserted cigarette C to reduce the rigidity of manufacturing tolerances. The mag- netic field lines can bridge the gap to inductively heat susceptor material in thermal contact with the tobacco flavor 5 medium. Such a configuration would produce a series of circular burn patterns on the cylindrical cigarette about its longitudinal axis. The firing sequence can be in any desired order, and preferably the induction source corresponding to the distal end of the cigarette relative to the mouth of the smoker, i.e., the outermost induction source relative to the smoker, is fired first. Preferably, the firing does not occur in a linear sequence along the cigarette longitudinal axis. As a result, circumferential rings of the tube of tobacco flavor medium are heated. 7. A circular cross section is preferred to shorten the mag- netic path, thus resulting in lower reluctance and higher permeability. A square cross section is preferred for manu- facturing. Each described induction source can comprise an excita- tion coil comprising single or multiple wires. The wire or wires are wound in a single or multiple turns. The number of amps of current per turn required to generate a magnetic field sufficient to heat the tobacco flavor medium via a susceptor is dependent on the application specific amount of energy delivered to the susceptor target, the maximum desired temperature, the desired rate of temperature rise, coil geometry, and the selected susceptor material(s). 10 Such a cylindrical tube configuration provides a smooth receptacle for repeated insertions of cigarettes. The tube is relatively strong compared to the cigarette and accordingly the induction heating sources should not be damaged upon insertion, adjustment and removal of the cigarettes. Also, a barrier is formed by the tube 120 to prevent potentially 20 component damaging vapors and off-odors from escaping to the other components and air passageways of the electrical smoking article. For example, when the excitation coil is activated, an alternating magnetic field is generated and collapses at the gap 224. Computer modeling indicates that the field strength is concentrated across gap 224 and that fringe field effects of this concentration interact with the inserted cigarette C. For successive firings, the ring-shaped induction source 235 and the inserted cigarette C are translated relative to one another to position successive portions of the cigarette in registry with the field concentrates gap 224. Preferably, induction source 235 is translated axially along the relatively station- ary cigarette by appropriate mechanical or electromechani- cal positioning mechanisms. As a result, circumferential rings of the tube of tobacco flavor medium are heated. 15 Another preferred embodiment is shown in FIGS. 6-7. The induction source 235 comprises a circular, donut-shaped 25 outer shell ring 222 having a hollow central region. The cylindrical cigarette C is inserted through this hollow central region. The ring 222 comprises the two half shells 220 and 221 which are joined and completely closed except for a ring-shaped, annular gap 224 through the inner circumfer- 30 ence of the ring. Outer shell ring 222 is preferably comprised of a ferrite material to collapse the magnetic field at the gap 224. Outer shell ring 222 encircles a wire wound to form an excitation coil 230 concentric with outer shell 222 and the inserted cigarette. The excitation coil 230 is connected to an appropriate circuit to generate an alternating magnetic field. 35 A spacer layer 240, which can be semi-circular as shown, is located between the wound excitation coil 230 and the outer shell 222 at gap 224. Spacer 240 serves to facilitate fabri- cation and to position the excitation coil relative to gap 224 to ensure consistent magnetic gap dimensions; ensure con- 40 sistent field strength around the annular gap by maintaining rotation orientation; and protect the excitation coil. Spacer 240 is preferably a material having a low magnetic perme- ability such as polyether(ether)ketone or PEEK® polymer commercially available from Imperial Chemical Industries 45 of Great Britain. In the foregoing examples shown in FIGS. 1-7, a cylin- drical cigarette is employed. A preferred cigarette construc- tion is disclosed in related patent application Ser. No. 08/118,665. The cigarette has a diameter of, e.g., approxi- mately 7.8 mm. Since the induction sources do not need to contact the cigarette to transfer energy thereto, the outer curvature of the cigarette does not need to closely approxi- mate the inner circumference of the induction sources 102, 235, thereby allowing for less stringent manufacturing tol- erances for the inductive sources and the cigarette C and significantly reducing collision damage to the cigarette C and/or the heater during insertion, adjustment or removal of the cigarette C. Of course, a snug retainment of the cigarette C is desired and can be maintained by close tolerance or a suitable retention mechanism (not shown). The aerosol generating tobacco flavor medium can take many forms such as filled cylindrical cigarettes, hollow cylindrical cigarettes, or continuous webs as discussed in greater detail below. Regardless of the format employed, the tobacco flavor medium should generate flavors and aerosols subjectively equivalent to a desired puff of a more conven- tional cigarette with each draw-activated firing of the par- ticular induction source. For example, a hollow cylindrical cigarette should replicate the 7-8 puffs, e.g., 8 puffs, of a conventional cigarette. The energy required to heat a 10.5 mm3 zone of mat of tobacco flavor medium having a density of 0.50 g/cm3 to a required temperature of 600° C. in 0.5 seconds is approximately 1.58 Joules. Of course, the heat capacity and density of the inductively heated susceptor must be taken into account. Preferably, in a layered suscep- tor/mat arrangement, the susceptor area corresponds to the mat area or is as large as practical with respect thereto since the efficiency of the heat transfer from the susceptor surface to the ultimate target of tobacco flavor medium surface increases as the surface area of the interface between the two surfaces increases. Such a structure results in the entire magnetic path being comprised of the outer shell ring 222 and the gap 224. When the relative permeability of the ferrite is high, the magnetic field strength is strictly a function of the gap characteristics and the excitation current. This embodiment relies on the relatively weak fringing field line emanating from the gap 224 toward the cigarette as opposed to the relatively strong magnetic field established in the gap. 50 55 The inner annular gap 224 is preferably equidistant through shell ring 222, i.e., the opposing inner faces of shell ring 222 which define gap 224 are parallel. If the faces are tapered toward the shell outer circumference, i.e., the gap spacing decreases toward the object to be heated, then the relative amount of field fringing increases. However, the magnitude of the fringing field remains approximately the same because the tapering reduces the effective area of the gap, which increases the magnetic path reluctance, which is turn decreases the ß-field strength. 60 The cigarette C described in the above patent application 65 Ser. No. 08/118,665 is a hollow cylinder comprised of a tobacco flavor medium, or material including tobacco flavor medium, and a paper overwrap preferably comprising a The interior cross section of ring 222 defined by half shells 220 and 221 is squared in FIG. 6 and circular in FIG.",92

A separate and discrete susceptor element SE can be employed which is a more permanent part of the smoking article, i.e., 5 along with the inductive sources, circuitry, logic, sensors, etc., and which is inductively heated by the induction source(s), to heat the tobacco flavor medium in thermal proximity therewith. In addition or alternatively, susceptor material is a part of the cylindrical cigarette or other format of the tobacco flavor medium. The separate susceptor ele- ment can comprise a washer coaxially located around an inserted cylindrical cigarette such that a portion of the washer intersects a radially extending gap of a toroid ring closed except for this gap. The thermal mass of such a discrete susceptor element should not be so high as to function as a heat sink to lower desired rates of temperature rise. with aluminum alone or in combination being preferred. Materials having similar ranges of electrical resistivity and magnetic permeability can be employed alone or in combi- nation. A desired susceptor thickness is between approxi- mately 0.25 and 0.5 mil. The paper overwrap 310 overlying susceptor 300 has a sufficient thickness and/or gaseous impermeability to retain the vast majority of the generated aerosols interior to the formed cylinder to ensure a maximum aerosol delivery to the smoker and to further reduce escape of aerosols from the cigarette interior which could cause component damaging condensation. The overwrap 310 should have sufficient thickness and/or burn rate characteristics to avoid being burned by the heated susceptor 300. As stated above, no eddy currents are generated in the paper overwrap by the inductive heating source. The order of the layers 300 and 310 could be reversed; however, such an arrangement would necessitate heat being unnecessarily conducted through the paper layer to the tobacco flavor medium, possibly produc- ing vapors. Appropriate adhesives are employed to bond the susceptor layer 300 to the paper overwrap 310 and the tobacco substrate. The susceptor layer 300 and the overwrap 310 can constitute a foil laminate, e.g., an aluminum foil laminate. 10 15 Referring to FIG. 8, a cigarette laminate cross-section is shown comprising a cylindrical layer of tobacco flavor 20 material TM, a cylindrical susceptor layer 300 overlying the TM layer, and a paper overwrap 310. The generated mag- netic field passes through the paper overwrap 310, which is not heated by eddy currents since paper has a high magnetic permeability, thereby reducing condensation since the paper 25 is not burned through by the magnetic field. The paper overwrap 310 is sized and fabricated so that the paper is not burned through by the heated susceptor. The generated magnetic field induces eddy currents in underlying susceptor layer 300. Susceptor layer 300 is thus heated and predomi- 30 nantly conductively heats the intimately contacting or proxi- mal tobacco material layer TM to evolve desired flavors. In addition to this susceptor/tobacco flavor medium lami- nate embodiment, other embodiments of the present inven- tion form a combined layer of tobacco flavor medium and susceptor. These embodiments minimize unintentional heat- ing of adjacent portions of tobacco flavor medium due to conduction from the inductively heated target susceptor, through another portion of the susceptor, and to the adjacent, non-target tobacco flavor medium portion. For example, susceptor materials SM are dispersed in the tobacco flavor medium TM in a sufficient amount to conductively heat the surrounding tobacco flavor medium when excited, as shown in FIG. 9. Susceptor medium SM can be continuous fibers, broken fibers, particles, or any combination thereof. These susceptor particles are not in a conductive relationship with one another to reduce undesired conductive heating of neighboring, non-target susceptors and tobacco flavor medium portions. These susceptor materials can be inter- posed in patterns to delineate target areas to be inductively heated. The susceptor material used in the present invention should have a low magnetic reluctance and a correspond- ingly high relative magnetic permeability to optimize the 35 surface eddy currents generated by an alternating electro- magnetic field of a given strength. The susceptor should also have relatively low electrical resistivities to increase Joule heat dissipation. The lower the product of specific heat and density, the greater the heating efficiency. A material with a 40 high relative permeability can be employed to invoke the additional heating mechanism associated with magnetic hysteresis. The susceptor layer 300 should have a thickness which is relatively thin relative to its particularized, excita- tion frequency-dependent skin depth so that the vast major- 45 ity of the magnetic field creates heat producing eddy cur- rents in the susceptor. This is especially advantageous when fringing fields from a split gap arrangement are present. As the thickness of the susceptor increases, the magnetic field is unable to penetrate deep enough into the material, neces- 50 sitating an undesired power increase requirement to heat the increased thermal mass of the susceptor. If the susceptor layer is too thin, e.g., much less than the skin depth, a low conversion of the magnetic field to heat energy via eddy currents occurs. If the susceptor layer is too thick, e.g., 55 greater than three skin depths, a high conversion efficiency results but the susceptor thermal load, i.e., the mass, reduces the rate of thermal rise. Most non-permeable metals reach an optimum magnetic field of, e.g., approximately 550 gauss at about a 2 mil thickness at an excitation frequency of 500 60 KHz. Preferably, the magnetic field is between approxi- mately 400 and 800 gauss. The minimum theoretical required power is 3.5 watts to reach a desired temperature of 500° C., from room temperature conditions in approxi- mately one second. Possibly suitable susceptor materials 65 may include conductive carbon such as graphite, aluminum, stainless steel, copper, bronze, or any combination thereof A particularly preferred embodiment is shown in FIGS. 10A-C. The susceptor comprises an integral layer 400 having various discontinuities 410 therethrough. For example, integral layer 400 can be a screen, mesh or perforated foil of a suitable susceptor material and is inter- meshed with, and preferably encapsulated or completely surrounded by, the tobacco flavor medium TM, as shown in FIGS. 10A and 10B. This arrangement increases the effec- tive interface area between the susceptor and tobacco flavor medium since the vast majority of the susceptor area is in thermal contact with the tobacco flavor medium to conduct heat thereto. Heat conduction in the plane of the susceptor 400 is decreased by the discontinuities 410, thereby reduc- ing heating of non-target portions of tobacco flavor medium. The mechanical, and more specifically the tensile, strength of such an embodiment is superior to that employing inter- posed susceptor particles since an integral frame is provided to support the tobacco flavor medium, especially the rela- tively fragile heated tobacco flavor medium. This configu- ration is also more flexible than a susceptor/tobacco flavor medium laminate due to the discontinuities, perforations, or openings. Also, such a configuration has a lower thermal mass than a discrete susceptor layer, lowering energy requirements. In addition, this susceptor geometry results in",93
"5,613,505 11 a faster thermal response for the susceptor, thereby favor- ably increasing the evolution rate of the aerosol flavor to more quickly heat the tobacco flavor medium. The discon- tinuities 410 allow the evolved aerosols to flow through the susceptor 400, increasing aerosol mass transfer in the desired flow direction. 12 FIGS. 11 and 13, the preferred C-shape of FIG. 2 is shown. Any other suitable geometry capable of producing an alter- nating ß field of sufficient strength can be employed. 5 The web W comprises or bears tobacco flavor medium. The web can have the general configuration described above in reference to FIGS. 8-10C. More specific embodiments will now be discussed with reference to FIGS. 12A-12G. The web W may be made of the tobacco flavor medium TM itself, formed into an elongated sheet form by methods that are well known in, e.g., the manufacture of reconstituted tobacco products, as shown is FIG. 12A. The tobacco flavor medium is mixed with susceptor material SM as discussed above in reference to FIG. 8 if the web is used in the embodiment of FIG. 11, and, if desired, with the embodi- ment of FIG. 13 employing a separate susceptor element. Such an alternative may be sufficient in some applications, depending on the smoking article, and the amount of friction and tension expected from web advancement. If the con- figuration is such that an unsupported web may break, especially after heating when the web is weakened, then an alternative like that shown in FIG. 12B may be used. As shown in FIG. 12B, web W is a laminate of tobacco flavor medium TM and a support layer 531. Support layer 531 may be a woven or non-woven carbon fiber mat, for which suitable carbon fibers might be one-inch-long chopped car- bon fibers available from Akzo Fortafil, Inc., of Rockwood, Tenn., a subsidiary of Akzo America, Inc., of Chicago, Ill., as FORTAFIL®3C. Layer 531 may also be any other suitable material e.g., suitably treated paper that adds strength to layer TM and can withstand the temperatures to which layer TM will be heated without generating subjective off tastes. Support layer 531 can function as a susceptor as described above in reference to FIG. 9 if the proper material is selected. If so, tobacco flavor medium layer TM can be provided with susceptor material SM or not, depending on whether the eddy currents generated in the susceptor support layer 531 are sufficient to adequately heat layer TM. Referring to FIG. 10C, an embodiment is shown com- prising a laminate of tobacco flavor medium TM, a layer of susceptor material SM, and a paper overwrap 310. The embodiment is similar to the embodiment of FIG. 8 except 10 that the layer of susceptor material SM comprises discrete portions of susceptor material separated by gaps. Thus gaps are relatively uniform as shown or can be tapered either toward paper overwrap 310 or the layer of tobacco flavor medium TM. 15 The discrete susceptor layer 300 described above can also have discontinuities and can take the form of a screen, mesh or perforated foil. For example, a paper foil laminate can be employed wherein strips of foil are provided. If an imper- meable susceptor layer is employed, a vapor barrier is 20 typically produced between the susceptor layer and the tobacco flavor medium TM. This vapor barrier reduces the heat transfer from the susceptor layer to the tobacco flavor medium. The presence of discontinuities permits the con- stituents which comprise the vapor barrier to pass through 25 the susceptor. This discontinuous susceptor can be employed to heat tobacco flavor medium in any desired geometrical shape for smoking. For example, the tobacco flavor medium can be in the form of a filled or hollow cylinder, as described in Ser. 30 No. 118,665 or a web such as that discussed in Ser. No. 08/105,346. As discussed above, to heat respective regions of the tobacco flavor medium to generate respective puffs, either the induction source is indexed relative to the tobacco flavor medium, or visa versa, or both are moved relative to each other. Preferred embodiments wherein the tobacco flavor medium is indexed relative to a stationary induction heating source are found in commonly assigned patent application Ser. No. 08/105,346. 35 It may be found that additional support is needed beyond that provided by support layer 531. As shown in FIG. 12C, web W further includes reinforcing strip 541. Strip 541 may be paper, metallic foil, or a foil/paper laminate. As seen in FIG. 12D, further support can be provided by a second reinforcing strip 551 similar to strip 541. 40 Ser. No. 08/105,346 discloses a system for registering a web of tobacco flavor medium in thermal proximity with an electrical resistance heat source. A portion of the web is supported in thermal proximity to the heat source, heated to generate a tobacco flavor substance, and then advanced past this registry point. If a supply of web is provided, this advancement results in a subsequent web portion being registered with the electrical heating source. 45 In another alternative embodiment, it may be found that strip 541, or the combination of strips 541, 551 is sufficient to support continuous tobacco flavor medium strip and two such alternate embodiments are shown in FIGS. 12E and 12F. As shown generally in FIGS. 11 and 13, a smoking article 50 500 has a powered capstan 502 driven by appropriate motor and gearing and an unpowered capstan 504. A supply of a web W of tobacco flavor medium is spun on a spool mounted on unpowered capstan 504 and is guided from the supply spool over an idle guide roller 510, into registry with an 55 induction heating source generally designated as IS, over idle guide rollers 512 and 514, to a take-up spool mounted on and driven by powered capstan 502. The registered web, described in greater detail below, is heated by susceptor(s) inductively heated by source IS to generate an aerosol in chamber 516 which is drawn by the smoker via mouthpiece 518. Another embodiment of a flavor web according to this invention is shown in FIG. 12G. In this embodiment, indi- vidual portions 591 of tobacco flavor medium TM are deposited on a carrier web 592. Any of the alternative structures shown in FIGS. 12B-12F can be used in this embodiment. This embodiment requires greater accuracy in web transport than the first embodiment, so that portions 591 are in inductive registry with the alternating magnetic field. However, depending on the relative heat conductivities of the various web materials, both embodiments must be 60 advanced approximately the same distance between puffs, as discussed above, to prevent reheating of tobacco flavor medium to avoid generation of off-tastes. The induction heating source IS can be any induction heating source according to the present invention. More specifically, the C-shaped or E-shaped induction heating 65 source 10 of FIGS. 1 and 2 or the induction heating source of FIGS. 6 and 7 having a split ring 222 are employed. In An alternative embodiment is shown in FIG. 13 wherein induction heating source IS inductively heats one or two susceptor elements of susceptor material SM located near, or contacting the web W travel, between the supply and take-up reels 502 and 504. The discrete element of any suitable",94
"5,613,505 13 susceptor material SM heats the web W which is in intimate thermal contact therewith. In the configuration shown, the susceptor roller(s) 515 is in the chamber 516 and is fixed relative to the web. Roller 515 can rotate to advance the web and can also translate slightly with the web to reduce tension 5 on the web. Web W can be any of the previously discussed embodiments of FIGS. 12A-12G and can contain additional susceptor material as described if necessary to adequately heat the tobacco flavor medium. 14 A preferred embodiment for providing a susceptor to inductively heat the tobacco flavor medium is now dis- cussed. This embodiment is applicable to tobacco flavor medium in the form of a cylindrical shape, a web, or any other suitable geometric shape to be smoked. of volatile flavor components. The curing can be accelerated by slightly elevating the curing temperature. The resulting susceptor patterns are flexible, permitting use with tobacco flavor medium substrates which are later rolled, bent or otherwise fabricated to achieve a specific geometry. The printed susceptor has a low mass, thus decreasing the amount of energy stored in the susceptor mass and resulting in greater heater transfer efficiency to the substrates. The susceptor ink can be applied using conventional printing technology such as the discussed screen or gravure printing. The printing and the rheological characteristics of the ink result in an integration of the heater film into the tobacco flavor medium substrate. This integration results in an intimate contact between the susceptor materials and the substrate, resulting in good thermal transfer via conduction. Also, such an integrated, printed susceptor is less likely to delaminate. 10 A susceptor material is employed having a high magnetic permeability and a low specific electrical resistivity such as any mentioned material which is capable of heating a tobacco substrate to temperatures necessary to produce aerosol delivery within a smoking device when exposed to an alternative magnetic field. For example aluminum or silver ink are employed. The susceptor is formed by mixing a food grade binder, e.g., a hydrocolloid such as pectin or Konjac, along with other minor components and a susceptor filler. The resulting ink is then applied in the desired geometry via a conventional method of application to the desired tobacco flavor medium and/or paper substrate. This ink can be used to fabricate susceptors of two general types. In the first case, the ink is cured by drying at low tempera- tures, e.g., about room temperature. This results in a sus- ceptor element which consists of conductive/resistive (per- meable) filler particles within the binder matrix. The time and temperature of curing determines the volumetric ratio of filler to binder and thus influences the measured reluctance of the element in accordance with percolation phenomena. This type of susceptor can be deposited and cured on substrates which cannot tolerate exposure to high tempera- tures, e.g., cellulose materials such as tobacco or paper. In the second case, the ink can be deposited on a high tem- perature substrate such as alumina and elevated to tempera- tures high enough and times long enough to oxidize the binder leaving a ""film"" composed of the susceptor material. The final magnetic reluctance will depend on the original loading of the filler in the ink, the filler material, the intimacy of the diffusion or flow of the filler material into the substrate surface, and the time temperature history of the deposited film. These parameters impact the final particle morphology which influences the resistance, apparent resis- tivity, of the element. 15 The amount of heat transferred depends on the type of susceptor material selected, the relative ratio of susceptor material to the ink, and the particular geometric pattern of ink employed. This pattern should be located on the tobacco flavor medium filler and paper such that the applied suscep- tor material is inductively registered with the generated magnetic field upon insertion and activation. 20 25 The susceptor ink can be applied as a uniform coating or layer as discussed in the above embodiments. Alternatively, a pattern can be printed for discrete regions, each region integrated and in intimate contact with a corresponding region of tobacco flavor medium sized to generate a puff. The printed susceptor regions are separated to avoid undes- ired induction heating of adjacent susceptor regions, e.g., the susceptor regions are spaced apart on a tobacco flavor medium substrate. 30 Regardless of the susceptor tobacco flavor medium con- figuration employed, the susceptor is in thermal contact with the tobacco flavor medium, i.e., these elements are located such that the inductively heated susceptor transfers a suffi- cient amount of heat to the tobacco flavor medium to evolve aerosols. 35 40 A simplified schematic is shown in FIG. 14 of an elec- trical smoking article employing an induction heater accord- ing to the present invention. The represented power source, e.g., a battery, 600, control circuitry 610, sensor 620 and optional motor/gearing 630 are described in greater detail in the noted related applications incorporated by reference herein. Sensor 620 generates a signal in response to the smoker drawing on the particular electrical article. The ""draw"" signal is fed to control circuitry 611 which sends a ""fire"" or discharge signal to the LC circuit 640. LC circuit 640 is powered by battery 600. The LC circuit 640 sends an alternating current to the single induction heater 650, or one or more of the plurality of heaters to generate the alternating magnetic field to heat the susceptor. Motor/gearing 630 is powered by battery 600 and activated by control circuitry 610 as described in Ser. No. 08/105,346 to register the induction heater or fixed susceptor with the moving web. Alternatively, motor/gearing 630 is used to move the ciga- rette and induction heater relative to one another as described. 45 The produced ink is applied to the paper and/or the tobacco flavor medium via screen printing, gravure printing, ink jet application, vapor disposition, vacuum disposition, plasma spraying, etc. 50 The susceptor ink is thus printed or otherwise deposited in paper and/or tobacco flavor medium. Preferably, the suscep- 55 tor is in contact with the tobacco flavor medium. If printed on paper, the susceptor is preferably in the side of the paper facing the tobacco flavor medium. The paper should be thick enough and/or have appropriate burn rate characteristics to minimize burning as the susceptor ink is heated. A paper 60 overwrap as discussed above can be employed. This embodiment offers several advantages. Various con- ventional food grade binders are used which are compatible with tobacco material. The curing of the ink is at room An exemplary control circuit shown in FIG. 15 consists of temperature, thereby simplifying the process and avoiding 65 a control circuitry 611 such as PWM (pulse width modu- undesired thermal post treatment of susceptors applied to the lated) control logic integrated circuit driver chip, which drives FET (Field Effect Transistor) driver transformers 615. tobacco flavor medium which could alter the concentrations Any appropriate circuit for generating an alternating current for the excitation coils to convert into an alternating magnetic field can be employed.",95
"5,613,505 15 The FET's 615, four as shown, are connected in a full bridge configuration. This preferential circuit topology is used to maximize the power transfer to the work excitation coil 614 while minimizing source impedance and reducing switching losses. The input supply voltage, depending on circuit 5 application, would range between 3 and 24 VDC. The power delivery from power supply 600 (shown in FIG. 14) to the work coil 614 is dynamically (realtime) monitored by the use of a current transformer 616. The scaled current from the current transformer 616 is routed into a first signal condi- tioning network 618 and converted into a voltage to provide an error signal to the PWM controller 611. The voltage scaled signal also feeds a second separate signal condition- ing network 622 which provides a varying DC signal related to the reflected impedance of the susceptor within a ciga- rette, and the susceptor's particular physical properties such as resistance, magnetic permeability, geometry, etc. This signal is routed into a circuit subsystem labelled signature processor 624. The cigarette susceptor's impedance is moni- tored upon cigarette insertion into the lighter subsystem, by 20 the application of less than 5% of the nominal applied power for short ""burst"" of a magnetic field having less strength than the magnetic field generated to heat the susceptor, i.e., the initial field is incapable of heating the susceptor.

"Jun. 8, 2006 US 2006/0118589 A1 1 SMOKELESS TOBACCO PRODUCT USER PACKAGE FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] The present invention relates to smokeless tobacco product user packages. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART [0002] Today, tobacco products, particularly in the form of oral snuff, are commonly available in powder form, where the user picks a snuff dose by his/her fingers from an open package. In order to provide oral snuff in a more hygienic and clean manner, it is also known to package oral snuff in separate small bags, each having a predetermined amount of snuff stored therein. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0003] An object with the present invention is to further improve the packaging of smokeless tobacco doses so that the tobacco product at each single instance is more easily accessible to the user in a wider range of desired amounts. [0004] According to one aspect the invention provides a smokeless tobacco product user package, comprising a closed housing for containing a continuous band comprising said smokeless tobacco product, an opening in said housing for exposing an outer end of said continuous band outside said housing and allowing outfeed of said continuous band from said housing and separation of a desired length of said outer end by the user, and a reclosable closure means for alternatively covering and exposing said outer end of said continuous band outside said housing. [0005] The package preferably also has a cutting means outside said housing for said separation of the desired length of said outer end outside the housing. In a preferred embodi- ment the cutting means is connected to the housing or the closure to thereby effect said cutting when said closure is manually closed by the user. [0006] The smokeless tobacco product is suitably an oral snuff product. [0007] Other objects and advantages of the invention are apparent from the following detailed description and the claims. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING [0008] FIG. 1 is perspective view of a first embodiment of a smokeless tobacco product user package according to the invention; [0009] FIG. 2 is an exploded view of a package shown in FIG. 1; [0010] FIG. 3 is an exploded perspective view of a second embodiment of a smokeless tobacco product user package according to the invention; [0011] FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a continuous band of a smokeless tobacco product for a package according to the invention; [0012] FIG. 5 is an exploded perspective view with parts broken away showing a continuous band of a smokeless tobacco product arranged for outfeed from a package by rotation of a part of the package; [0013] FIG. 6 is a fragmentary view, partially in section, showing an alternatively manner of storing a smokeless tobacco product in a package according to the invention; [0014] FIG. 7 is a perspective view of another embodi- ment of another smokeless tobacco product user package container according to the invention; [0015] FIG. 8 is a perspective view of a bottom housing half of the container according to FIG. 7; and [0016] FIG. 9 is a perspective view of a spool for a continuous band of a smokeless tobacco product to be used in a package according to the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0017] The smokeless tobacco product according to the invention, in one embodiment comprises a so called oral snuff product comprising a particulate or powdery tobacco product that is provided in portions 42 (FIG. 1-3 and 6) either in a powder state (not shown) or a pellet shape having a tobacco dough consistency, where in the latter case a thickening agent could be added to the tobacco product powder. [0018] The portions 42 are packaged in pockets one after another in a spaced relation between layers of flexible sheet bonded together face to face and forming a band or ribbon 40. The flexible sheet is preferably a paper, for example a non-woven paper, permeable to tobacco ingredients and well-known in the art for oral snuff portion bags. The layers of flexible sheet may be composed optionally of two sepa- rate sheets or a single sheet that is folded once over itself (not shown). [0019] In another embodiment shown in FIG. 4 the smokeless tobacco product 42 itself forms the continuous band 40. In this embodiment, a thickening agent is also added to the wet tobacco product to change the consistency making the flexible band shape possible. [0020] According to the invention, the band is contained in a package 10 comprised of a small snuff box, container or housing 12, where the band 40 is compacted into a wound roll shape or a compressed meander or zigzag shape (FIG. 6). Preferably, a free end 46 of the band 40 is exposed from an opening 20 in the housing 12 so that the user can pull a desired length of smokeless tobacco product 18 from the housing 12 and tear off the desired length of band 40. [0021] In the preferred embodiment, the opening is a slit 20 defined by a pliable or yielding piece 22 of material that allows pulling the band 40 forward but prevents the free end 46 of the band 40 from unintentionally slipping back into the container 12. The material is preferably a flexible plastic film 22 that flexes outwards on pulling the free end 46 but may also be other pliable materials such as an expanded pliable plastics material (not shown). [0022] A reclosable lid or closure means 26 is connected by an integral hinge 30 to one 14 of two halves 14, 32 defining the housing 12. In its closed position (not shown) the lid covers the free end 46 of the band 40 in a closed space defined by a recessed wall 16 of the housing half 14, housing side wall portions 24, 24 and the lid 26. Snap lock means (not shown) on the side wall portions 24 and/or the lid 26 will lock the lid 26 in its closed position until its opened by",104
"Jun. 8, 2006 US 2006/0118589 A1 2 the user putting his/finger into a recess 18 under a protruding free end of the lid and forcing it upwards. [0023] To facilitate the separation of the band 40, band 40 can be provided with weakened lines such as perforations 43 (FIG. 6) between each pair of portions 20 in the case of pocketed portions. In the case of continuous tobacco product according to FIG. 4, the smokeless tobacco dough is easily tearable in itself but may if needed also be provided with weakening lines such as traversing depressions (not shown) defining the product portions therebetween. [0024] In the shown embodiments the box 12 is, however, provided with a cutting means in the shape of a knife 28 or the like for cutting the band apart at a distance from the opening 20 exposing the free end 46 of the band 40. More precisely, the user pulls the free end 46 of the band 40 a desired length past the range of the lid 26 and then manually closes the lid, whereby the knife 28 becomes effective to cut the desired length off outside the closed lid 26. [0025] In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the knife 30 is mounted on the recessed wall 16. The knife is cooperating with a counter edge 27 on the lid 28 to facilitate the cutting action. [0026] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 3 the knife 28 is mounted on the lid 26. In this case, the knife 28 is cooper- ating with a counter edge 17 on the housing 12. To have a still cleaner cut, the knife 28 may be received in a narrow slit in the respective counter part when the lid 26 is closed (not shown). [0027] In the embodiments of FIGS. 1-4 the band 40 is stored in the shape of a wound roll in the housing 12. [0028] In the embodiment of FIGS. 1 and 2, the free end 46 of band 40 is taken from the inside of a stationary wound roll. In this arrangement the band 40 inevitably becomes twisted when pulled straight out from the housing 12. To overcome this problem, the compliant slit 20 can suitably be slightly over dimensioned for allowing folds resulting from this twisting of the band 40 to pass through the slit 20 (not shown). [0029] In the embodiments of FIGS. 3 and 4, the band 40 is wound onto a bearing sleeve 50 which is journalled on a shaft 34 protruding from the inside of the housing half 32. [0030] As mentioned in the foregoing, the continuous smokeless tobacco band 40 of FIG. 4 has a dough consis- tency. This may cause the individual turns of the roll to stick to each other. Therefore, the turns are preferably separated by a ribbon 44 of a non-adhesive material such as a release paper well known in the art. [0031] The continuous smokeless tobacco band 40 may also be relatively stiff compared to the highly flexible non-woven paper material supporting the product portions 42 in the embodiment of FIG. 3. Instead of pulling the band 40 out of the housing it is therefore in this case also possible to push it out from the inside. To this end, as is indicated in FIG.6, the band 40 may be directly wound stuck onto the hollow shaft 34 which in turn is journalled as a sleeve on a counter shaft 15 protruding form the other housing half 14. Accordingly, when the user rotates housing half 32 in the direction of arrow 36 relative to housing half 14, the free end of band 40 will be pushed out of the package. [0032] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 6 the band 40 of smokeless tobacco portions 42 is packed in a dense mean- dering manner in a parallelepipedic housing 12. In order that the portions will effectively fill out the interior of the housing 12, the band 40 and portions 42 are spaced and shaped in a complementary manner so that when the band is folded back over itself, elevated portions 42 of one side of one part of the band 40 will fit into the voids of an opposing side of an adjacent part of the band 40. [0033] An alternative embodiment of a container or hous- ing 12 according to the invention is shown in FIG. 7. In this case the upper half 14 of housing 12 is formed as a cover that is rotatably supported on a peripheral rim 33 (FIG. 8) on the bottom half 32 of the housing. The upper half 14 has a peripheral opening 13 in its peripheral wall, serving as a closure means 26, for exposing the above mentioned closed space outside the recessed wall 16 in the rotational position shown in FIG. 7 of the upper half 14. The bottom half 32 of the housing has further an additional space 15 for storing used product portions. The additional space is fully exposed by rotating the upper half 14 relative to the bottom half 32 approximately 90 degrees clockwise from the position shown in FIG. 7. [0034] Further, in this alternative embodiment the cutting means 28 is formed at one of the lateral edges of the peripheral opening 13. In this case, the free end of the band (not shown) is separated by the cutting means, for example by rotating the upper half 14 counter-clockwise in FIG. 7 until the free end of the band is trapped between the cutting means 28 and the opposite end of the closed space outside the recessed wall 16. Thereafter the user can tear the free end apart from the band. [0035] FIG. 9 finally shows a spool 52 as an alternative for the bearing sleeve 50 (FIG. 3, 4) and having a pair of opposite radial retaining flanges 54, 56. 1.

Further, the outer packing is, generally wrapped with a transparent sheet of packing paper. 15 When a package of cigarettes packed in the above-described conventional packaging manner is opened, an opening is defined through the packaging sheet on the side of the tops of the cigarettes so that the interior of the package is communicated with the surrounding atmosphere. As a result, aroma and natural flavours inherent to the packaged cigarettes tends to be lost; cigarettes are scattered to surrounding atmosphere; cigarettes and the package are 20 deformed. United States Patent No. 4,920,728 issued May 1, 1990 to K. Shibuya, describes a method wherein a thin sheet with a suitable degree of flexibility is interposed between tips of cigarettes to be packed in a package and the inner surface of a top of the package so that when the portion of the package is opened to define a cigarettes picking up opening, the thin sheet remains in said opening in the form of an inner cover or lid. 25 However, there still remains a need for providing cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, kreteks, bidis and the like in packaging which maximizes retention of the flavour and enables each cigarette to stay fresh and dryer longer. Further, a means in which to better protect the cigarettes from becoming broken and crushed is also needed. Yet further, there is a need to 30 prevent counterfeiting of cigarette by designing difficult to reproduce techniques, such as holographic images and encryption, into the package design. Yet still further, it is most desirable to be able to reduce the amount of unhealthy and unnatural moisturizers and humectants, now used as additives and preservatives in the cigarettes, by eliminating the",109
"PCT/CA2004/000353 WO 2004/080843 amount of air exposure to each cigarette in the packaging and loss of moisture from the packaging. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 5 It is an object of the present invention to provide improved packaging for cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, kreteks, bidis and the like, which enables the cigarettes to stay fresher and dryer longer by being conveniently individually wrapped and dispensed in such a way as to provide an improved barrier to moisture, light, UV, oxygen, other gases and the like. 10 It is a further object to provide an improved means of packaging which better protects the cigarettes from becoming damaged, crushed or broken. It is a further object to provide an improved means of packaging which reduces or eliminates unnatural moisturizing agents, additives, humectants and the like that are currently needed to preserve cigarette freshness and, thus, prolong shelf life. 15 Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides a roll of tape formed of flexible material and having a length and a plurality of sealed, air-tight elongate chambers along said length, wherein each chamber is adapted to retain a cigarette or the like, wherein a selected number of each of said chambers is defined in part by an intercavity portion.

DEATAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMODIMENTS 20 With reference to FIGS. 1-4, these show generally as 10 a roll of tape formed of a complementary pair of films 12, 14 formed of a flexible material and having a length and a plurality of sealed, air-tight chambers along its length, wherein each chamber is adapted to retain a cigarette or the like and wherein a selected number of each of the chambers is defined in part by an interchamber portion 26, bonded by lamination one to the other at each side and 25 edge portions 16, 18, respectively, to define a plurality of sealed, air tight chambers 20 along the length of tape 22. Each chamber 20 holds an individual cigarette 24. Between each . chamber 20, interchamber portion 26 has a plurality of perforations or serrations 28 perpendicular to length 22 of tape 10, by which each segment of tape 10 holding cigarette 24 may be separated from its adjacent neighbour. 30 One side of tape 10 is provided with a plurality of tinfoil tabs 30, one per chamber 10 of sufficient finger gripping area as to enable tabs 30 to be pulled upwardly and outwardly to operably constitute tear-open means to give access to a cigarette retained in chamber 10. Also, along the flanking portions 16 of each chamber, the bonding of the plastic films 12, 14 are weakened to enable ease of separation by the action of pull-tabs 30. 6",114
"PCT/CA2004/000353 WO 2004/080843 The tape 10 may be made by lamination of suitably shaped films 12, 14 by methods known in the art. In an alternative embodiment of roll 10, shown in Fig. 3 generally as 100, a single film of a plastics material 102 is laminated to an intermittent plurality of tin foil strip portions 104 to define a plurality of chambers 106, each of which holds a cigarette 24 as analogously hereinabove described. Roll 10 similarly has the desired perforations and tabs to enable pull- off removal of tin foil tab 30 to release a cigarette 24. 5 FIG. 4 shows a plurality of tape strips, generally as 202, 204, 206, according to the invention, alternatively packaged in a flat, folded-over, even manner rather than in a roll and provides improved minimal thickness and, preferably, enables e.g. 20-25 cigarettes- containing strips to be fitted into a cardboard sleeve; shown in dashed outline 108. 10 FIG. 5A shows generally as 300, a housing 302 having vertical side walls 304, 306 and 308, with a fourth removal side wall 310, base 312 and top 314. The side walls, top and bottom define a roll of cigarette tape 316 receiving box chamber 318. Removable side wall 310 (FIG. 5B) is lockable to housing 302 by lock and key mechanism 320 which cooperates with housing vertical protrusion 322. 15 Front side wall 308 has an elongate aperture 324 parallel and adjacent to base 312 of such dimensions as to allow the close passage of tape 316, therethrough when received, essentially in so close proximity to the sides of aperture 324 as to prevent unwanted manipulation of tape 316. 20 Affixed to side wall 306 is a pair of longitudinal steel guide bars 326, 328, parallel one to the other essentially the length of wall 306, but distant one from the other. Between guide bars 326, 328 is a shorter steel bar 330 horizontally moveable between bars 326, 328. Welded to front end 332 of bar 330 is a vertical steel bar 334. 25 Housing top 314 has a longitudinal aperture 338, running between side rear wall 304 and front side wall 308 at its front half 336 adjacent side wall 308 at its front half 336 adjacent side wall 308. Vertical bar 334 has an upper handle portion 340 which protrudes through aperture 338, and a lower portion 342 to which is pivotally retained by bolt 345 a cam member 344 consisting of a steel arm 346 pivotal on bolt 345 in a vertical plane and a 30 cigarette-abutting metal rod 348, integral with and perpendicular to arm 346 as to constitute a tape or cigarette chamber abutting member. Bar 330, at its front end 348, has an integrally- formed planar protruding stop 350, so engageable with planar locking member 352 of locking member 354 that rearward movement of bar 330 is prevented unless planar member 352 is turned out of abutment with stop 350, by means of key 356. 7",115
"PCT/CA2004/000353 WO 2004/080843 Fixed midway of horizontal lower bar 328 is a similar cam arrangement consisting of vertical bar 358, cam member 360, which is pivotally retained by bolt 362 on bar 358 and to which is integrally-formed cigarette/tape 316 abutting rod 364 perpendicular to bar 360. Forward and upward movement of rod 364 is effected by forward movement of cigarette/tape 316 when the latter is operably pulled through aperture 324 when desired. Thus, rod 364 rolls over each cigarette and falls back onto the tape at each inter-cigarette chamber location 26, in turn. 5 Bar 358 has a metal stop 366, outstanding perpendicularly from bar 358, which stop abuts cam member 360 when the latter is in a vertical position as to prevent rearward movement of rod 364 beyond stop 366's vertical position and, thus, prevents rearward movement of tape 316 within housing 302. 10 Thus, in operation, a roll of tape 316 is loaded into box chamber 318 when housing 302 is open when side wall 310 is absent, and a length of tape 316 is opened and spread out along base 312 under rods 344 and 360, as far as aperture 324. Side wall 310 is affixed and 15 housing 302 locked by key 320. No part of tape 316 protrudes through aperture 324. Handle 340 is locked in place by locking member 352. To dispense cigarette/tape 316 through aperture 324, locking member 352 is turned by key 356 to release handle 340. Handle 340 is pushed rearwardly along aperture 338 to a desired distance commensurate with the number of cigarettes to be dispensed in that 20 operation as desired. In this action rod 348 rides over the desired number of cigarettes. Tape 316 cannot move rearwardly because of engagement of rod 364 in an inter-cigarette chamber portion 368 with the adjacent forward cigarette because of fixed stop 366 acting on cam member 360. Forward movement of handle 340 causes tape 316 to pass through aperture 324 by the 25 abutment of rod 348 with the cigarette forward thereof and the ""pushing"" of the cigarette in a forward movement. Once handle 340 has reached the forward end of aperture 338, the operation can be repeated or handle 340 locked through activation of member 352 by rotary movement of key 356. Although this disclosure has described and illustrated certain preferred embodiments 30 of the invention, it is to be understood that the invention is not restricted to those particular embodiments. Rather, the invention includes all embodiments, which are functional or mechanical equivalence of the specific embodiments and features that have been described and illustrated. 8",116
